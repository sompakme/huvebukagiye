Actually, when you read about the models’ dedication to looking flawless in lingerie while walking a runway, you can see why many would consider it to be brutal. Most of the models dedicate 2-hours each day to working out to keep their bodies trim and in shape. Yet, not every model does the same workout, because not every model has the same interests. It’s actually pretty amazing to notice all the different workouts that each girl can do and yet they all have the same type of slim and toned bodies. Although, while their workouts might different, there is one thing that the girls have in common. All the Victoria models follow strict diet and exercise routines. We already mentioned that they hit the gym 2-hours per day leading up the shows. Yet, did we mention that the girls are doing those 6 days per week? It’s no wonder that most journalists how have normal jobs and social lives found it difficult to keep up with models strict workout regimens.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, if you’re one of those girls who only have a few minutes each day to spare, don’t worry. You don’t have to go hard-core and dedicate hours of your day to working out. A lot of the model’s routines can also be done in 20-40 minutes too. In fact, some of their routines can even be done from the comfort of your home. Although, don’t say we didn’t warn you that these workouts are INTENSE! So, read on and try at your own risk.</p><h2 id=zumba>Zumba</h2><p>Models love to switch things up with their workout routines to ensure that their physiques stay perfectly toned and they never get bored. Model Maria Borges is just one of many models who loves to switch up her routine by adding in Zumba as a way to work out her body.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This workout is fun and you get the dance! Who wouldn't want to do that? Zumba is a Latin-infused dance that is used as a workout routine. It is an exercise fitness program that was created by Alberto Beto that got increasingly known for models as well as many others in the world. It’s a perfect way to&nbsp;try and get to the body you want and have a fun time doing it. Plus, you get to learn different dance moves. What model wouldn't love to do Zumba?</p><h2 id=heather-marr-s-bulgarian-workout>Heather Marr’s Bulgarian Workout</h2><p>Heather Marr’s Bulgarian workout is excellent at toning women’s bodies for long and lean muscles. There's not just one boring drill you have to keep doing to get in shape.

He's helped many women attain that 'supermodel' body.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some of his workouts can be ten minutes, some thirty, and other much longer.

And, like anyone else they also have a tendency to become bored doing the same workout over and over. That's why HIIT workouts are perfect for models that want to have fun and are time-sufficient.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With only twenty minutes of a workout, a lot can be burned in that small amount of time. This is due to the high-intensity exercises followed up with a low-activity rest. That's right. Even if these exercises can be fun, it will take a lot of endurance to achieve. Rest is essential for these drills. Remember that. Some examples of HIIT workouts can include treadmill sprints, Stairmaster, jump rope, cycle sprints and multiple variations of reps for each body part. Depending on if you want muscle gain or fat loss, your diet will vary accordingly.</p><h2 id=boxing>Boxing</h2><p>A lot of models love boxing when it comes to working out. Many Victoria Secret models especially. It burns a lot of calories, is easy and can be done in an hour or less if you'd like. It happens to be a full-body exercise that can get you in shape and beat out emotions. It’s anaerobic workout that improves hand-eye coordination.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many women feel accomplished and become stronger when they box. It’s one of Adrianna Lima’s favorite ways to work on her 'supermodel' body. You don't even need a punching bag. Boxing can be incorporated in many ways. You can practice your punches, kicks and body movements. Even with just a pair of gloves and partner, boxing is possible. Plus, it requires 100 percent focus, which some may love to get really into their workout for excellent results.</p><h2 id=305-fitness>305 Fitness</h2><p>Another dance workout is called 305 Fitness. Named after Miami, Florida's area code, it was inspired by the nightlife club scene. Sadie Kurzban is the founder of 305 Fitness, but anyone can do her workout routine. It's more of a fun dance routine that happens to make you sweat.

So you'll have to be prepared for this one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=barre>Barre</h2><p>Barre workout routines are a remarkably different method when it comes to working out. It is a form of ballet, using ballet postures and a mix of yoga and Pilates too. This is great for models that like to have a workout that is a lot less intense but still works out the body. Not only that, but it helps calm the mind, which overall decreases any stress happening in your life. That makes a happy, healthy workout.</p><p>To anyone who wants his or her posture to improve, this is for you. It helps with that, along with weight loss of course and increased flexibility. You can understand now why this would be great for models. Think of the calmness needed to walk on that runway. The balance and well-balanced postures required.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=soul-cycle>Soul Cycle</h2><p>Soul Cycle is very popular in New York and San Francisco, but ultimately can be done wherever. If attending one of those studios in New York or San Fran, the classes can be up to forty-five minutes. This means that you will burn roughly 700 hundred calories per session.

A way to tighten and tone your muscles without getting a bulky body, Pilates is perfect for models. It's a favorite for models such as Alessandra Ambrosio.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, this workout is&nbsp;not at all easy. Pilates can surprisingly be very challenging on the mind and body to achieve. Some models even threw in extra work for themselves. They do by adding yoga, barre or resistance bands. For excellent results&nbsp;concerning Pilates,&nbsp;one should practice at least two or three times a week. The more you practice, the better you will feel and notice an improvement in your body. Flexibility, increased strength, equal muscular strength and enhanced muscular control of your back are only a few to name.</p><h2 id=strength-training>Strength Training</h2><p>Strength training probably has even more health benefits. With an improvement in your heart, balance, bone strength and weight loss, strength training is another model workout to get into. The reaping benefits are endless, and you'll be happy you got into it. It builds strength while losing weight in different ways. Some examples of strength training are squats, bench press, deadlifts, barbells, using weights and much more. The opportunities and choices are endless.

But even if you want to challenge yourself, go for it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The purpose behind it is to build your overall strength. Models can also practice swimming, jump rope, and boxing, anything that requires strength building. Picking one that you genuinely enjoy doing will help you keep at it for that perfect model body you want to achieve.</p><h2 id=running>Running</h2><p>Running is the most straightforward way that models get their cardio in to stay a healthy weight. It's easy and simple to do. And, you can do it pretty much anywhere you'd like. You can even&nbsp;run on the spot. It’s all about what you prefer.</p><p>Model Karlie Koss swears by it.

It can not make you feel tired.’</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cross-fit>Cross Fit</h2><p>Crossfit is a new and exciting way to work out the body. It’s another short workout that fits into the high-intensity section when it comes to working out your body. It's a fast-paced workout that can be only fifteen minutes.

It tones muscle, and boosts your resting metabolism, so you continue burning calories after the class is over’.

Stress falls away, and the room becomes an ecosystem of collective accomplishment.’</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=body-by-simone-dance-cardio>Body by Simone Dance Cardio</h2><p>Another great dance workout is Body by Simone Dance Cardio.
