These beautiful women have amazing bodies that are kept in perfect shape, and they have no issues with showing them off in the name of artistic integrity. They tackle each role with a ferocity and dedication that few are capable of, and the rise of popular Hispanic actresses is a wonderful thing to see. Instead of being typecast as criminals or as a fish out of water, these women are now getting roles that used to be reserved for others. This is due in large part to their commitment to refining their craft, and their openness when it comes to appearing nude and appealing to a male audience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While not every actress in Hollywood is willing to appear in the buff, these women dared to be bold, and showed the world their assets to better their films. Some of the names on this list will shock you, and some will even jog memories of hitting the theaters and having your mother cover your eyes during their now infamous scenes. The 15 beautiful Latina women that made the cut are no strangers to the big screen, and most are household names. A few are up-and-comers that will be ruling the entertainment industry one day. Regardless of their current position in the landscape of the film industry, these 15 beauties were willing to do whatever it took to perfect their role, and the world was better for it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-lopez---money-train><strong>Jennifer Lopez - Money Train</strong></h2><p>The gorgeous <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lopez</a> conquered the entertainment industry back in the 90s, and has had a stranglehold ever since. She has had massive amounts of success in film and in music, making her career unique among her peers. The Selena actress has been considered one of Hollywoodâ€™s most beautiful women since her climb to the top, and this is largely due to her fitness and her incredible assets. Lopez has one of the best booties in Hollywood, and men around the world have been left begging for more each time she hits the big screen. Back in 1995, Lopez gave fans everywhere a quick look at everything they had been wanting to see.</p><p>In the film Money Train, Lopezâ€™s scene with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wesley Snipes</a> cranked up the heat, and fans rejoiced. Lopez gave them more than their moneyâ€™s worth, and even though the film was lackluster in storytelling, the infamous scene more than made up for it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sofia-vergara---leaked-modeling-video><strong>Sofia Vergara - Leaked Modeling Video</strong></h2><p>Currently, Colombian beauty <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sofia Vergara</a> is experiencing a level of fame reserved for very few individuals. She is the toast of the town, and her show Modern Family has been wildly successful since its debut back in 2009. Her transition into film has yielded mixed results in terms of box office receipts, but fans still canâ€™t get enough of her. She has provided viewers with plenty of sexy modeling shoots and movie scenes, but everything had seemingly been under her control. That is, of course, until an old modeling video of Vergara showing off her assets hit the Internet.</p><p>Needless to say, the video broke the internet, and had fans everywhere in complete shock. Vergara has taken the whole thing in stride, and has been a good sport about the footage surfacing. The clip of a younger Vergara modeling is truly a sight to see, and the video has made its way around the Internet countless times.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=salma-hayek---desperado><strong>Salma Hayek - Desperado</strong></h2><p>If taking your clothes off in films was an Olympic sport, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Salma Hayek</a> would have taken the gold medal on countless occasions. The timeless Mexican beauty has maintained a very successful career in Hollywood due to her amazing ability to captivate viewerâ€™s attention with her acting and with her assets. Since her breakout role in 1995â€™s Desperado, Hayek has kept the public satisfied with her work on the big screen. Her critical acclaim is much deserved, and her nominations for both Academy Awards and Golden Globe Awards is proof that Hayek is among the best in the business, even when her clothes are still on.</p><p>The list of movies that feature Hayek baring it all is quite extensive, and fans have been treated by the star on multiple occasions. If youâ€™re looking to see where it all started, go give the film Desperado a watch. We promise that you wonâ€™t regret it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rosario-dawson---he-got-game><strong>Rosario Dawson - He Got Game</strong></h2><p>Whether she is jockeying a register at the local Moobyâ€™s or tending to the wounds of Marvel heroes in Hellâ€™s Kitchen, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rosario Dawson</a>&nbsp;remains perhaps the most underrated beauty in Hollywood. Her acting is always perfect for each role that she takes on, and her gorgeous looks have garnered her a great deal of attention throughout her career. Her current work in Marvelâ€™s Netflix Universe has seen the actress be a bridge between several different series, and she was the perfect choice for the role. Much like Salma Hayek, Dawson is no stranger to baring it all on the big screen, and she has taken it all off in several films.</p><p>Of the films that she has been in the buff, He Got Game is perhaps the best of the bunch. So, if you are looking to see the beautiful Rosario Dawson give you your moneyâ€™s worth and watch a good movie, He Got Game is the choice for you.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=eva-mendes---training-day><strong>Eva Mendes - Training Day</strong></h2><p>Hailing from Miami, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eva Mendes</a> had a relatively quick rise to fame in the entertainment industry, though her career has since cooled off in recent years. After breaking out in 2001â€™s Training Day, Mendes was a hot commodity in Hollywood, and her breathtaking looks and solid performing landed her several high-profile roles. She has been featured in some of the biggest film franchises of all-time, cementing her place in fans hearts. Her work has spanned practically every genre on the spectrum, showing that she is adept at thriving in a number of different roles.</p><p>Her role in Training Day put the world on notice, but not just because her acting work in the film was solid. Her decision to bare it all in the film was a catalyst for her career, though had her acting been subpar, she wouldnâ€™t have been such a highly sought-after talent. For an underrated film with gratuitous screen time by Mendes, give the film We Own the Night a watch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nadine-velazquez---flight><strong>Nadine Velazquez - Flight</strong></h2><p>I am a huge fan of the show My Name Is Earl, so it goes without saying that I think <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nadine Velazquez</a> is one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood. Coincidentally, The League is another personal favorite, and she is heavily featured in that show as well. Velazquez has been in the entertainment industry for 14 years now, and she has enjoyed a great deal of success in television, having been on 2 hit shows. Her work in film may leave something to be desired, but her role in the movie Flight will leave you speechless.</p><p>In the film, Velazquez had audiences everywhere begging for more as she bared it all for the world to see. Her modeling work and even her work on television have given viewers a piece but this scene in Flight was the whole pie. Velazquez is currently working on the show Six, which has been renewed for its second season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=michelle-rodriguez---the-assignment><strong>Michelle Rodriguez - The Assignment</strong></h2><p>Fans of the Fast and Furious franchise are no stranger to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michelle Rodriguez</a>, as she has been a major part of the franchiseâ€™s success dating all the way back to its first film in 2001. The films have continued to have unfathomable amounts of success, with the last several installments cracking the coveted $1 billion mark. Outside of her work in the Fast and Furious&nbsp;franchise, Rodriguez has starred in a number of high-profile films, and is one of the worldâ€™s most successful female action stars. Give her level of fame and the success of her films, Michelle is considered one of Hollywoodâ€™s hottest and toughest women.</p><p>In 2016, Rodriguez did the unthinkable, and appeared nude on the big screen in The Assignment. The film only saw a limited release and was by no means a major success, but the prospect of Michelle Rodriguez appearing nude in a film no doubt fueled interest in the film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=christina-ochoa---stay-with-me><strong>Christina Ochoa - Stay With Me</strong></h2><p>As one of the newest shows to hit SyFy, Blood Drive has only aired 6 episodes, but has left a huge impression on fans thanks to Spanish beauty Christina Ochoa. The 32-year-old actress has had a very modest career thus far, but thanks to Blood Drive, appears to be on the fast track to stardom. She is easy on the eyes, and has shown the ability to be the face of a television show. I suggest that you familiarize yourself with Ochoa before she becomes a major star, because she has that type of potential.</p><p>Her work in the short film Stay With Me is solid, and should be the first piece of film that you check out. Aside from the obvious reason of her acting ability being on display, the film includes a scene that will have you running to see her in Blood Drive. Yes, she is that hot.</p><h2 id=roselyn-sanchez---boat-trip><strong>Roselyn Sanchez - Boat Trip</strong></h2><p>Puerto Rican stunner <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Roselyn Sanchez</a> may have made her film debut back in 1992 in Captain Ron, but it would be another decade before she truly broke out. After appearing in the film Rush Hour 2, Sanchezâ€™s career exploded, and she hasnâ€™t looked back since. Her roles in Without A Trace, Act Of Valor, and Devious Maids helped catapult her to the top of the heap in Hollywood, and she has maintained immense popularity over the last 15 years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her acting in Without A Trace is no doubt the most impressive work in her career, but a quick look at some other projects will have you scouring the Internet looking for copies of them. Sanchez had people dropping their jaws in the films Boat Trip and Yellow. She is talented, gorgeous, and also happens to be a musician, releasing 1 album back in 2003. Sanchez is easily one of the most talented performers in the entertainment industry.</p><h2 id=zoe-saldana---colombiana><strong>Zoe Saldana - Colombiana</strong></h2><p>If there is a big-budget movie that takes place in space, you can almost guarantee that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zoe Saldana</a> will find herself in the cast. After all, she has been featured in Guardians Of The Galaxy, Star Trek, and Avatar. Given the fact that she is both talented and beautiful, you wonâ€™t hear a single complaint about her being cast in these roles. The beautiful Saldana has proven time and time again that she is one of Hollywoodâ€™s premiere performers, and studios are more than happy to cast her in franchise films. However, if youâ€™re looking for the best of both worlds, there is only one film out there that will suffice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Back in 2011, Saldana starred in the film Colombiana, and the action-packed movie gave fans more than they could have asked for. Sure, it didnâ€™t leave critics in awe and only had a modest run at the box office, but it was still worth the watch.</p><h2 id=ana-de-armas---multiple-films><strong>Ana de Armas - Multiple Films</strong></h2><p>29-year-old Ana de Armas may have only crossed over into American films a few years ago, but she has left an incredible impression with each role that she has taken on. Beginning with the 2015 film Knock Knock, de Armas has exploded onto the scene, and shows no signs of slowing down. The Cuban actress has some of the most beautiful eyes in Hollywood, and they make it easy for her to capture viewers' attention in each role she takes on. Now, if youâ€™re looking to get the full de Armas experience, well, youâ€™re in luck. You will have a harder time finding a film where she doesnâ€™t take it all off.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ana may be young and new to the game, but she has an upward trajectory that is nearly unparalleled. Later this year, de Armas will be appearing in the film Blade Runner 2049, which is one of the most anticipated sequels of all-time. If everything goes according to plan, the film will dominate the box office, and de Armas will become a household name.</p><h2 id=laura-harring---mulholland-drive><strong>Laura Harring - Mulholland Drive</strong></h2><p>Considering that Laura Harring is the first Latina to win Miss USA, it goes without saying that her beauty was a catalyst to beginning a successful career in Hollywood. To maintain that career, however, Harring needed to sharpen her skills. 27 years after her film debut, Harring is still going strong in the business. Harring has been featured in a number of hit films, and her appearance in the soap opera Sunset Beach proved that she could have a successful run in television as well. Back in 2001, the beautiful Harring turned heads everywhere, and delivered one of the steamiest performances in quite some time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Upon its release, Mulholland Drive was a polarizing film that kept critics divided. It received a lot of praise and a high amount of criticism, and lines in the sand were quickly drawn. The filmâ€™s modest haul at the box office left a lot to be desired, but those who have seen the movie know that Harring spiced things up, and delivered a legendary scene.</p><h2 id=jordana-brewster---the-invisible-circus><strong>Jordana Brewster - The Invisible Circus</strong></h2><p>Appearing in the Fast and Furious franchise on several occasions, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jordana Brewster</a> has kept fans of the franchise begging for more with each appearance that she makes in the series. Most recently, she appeared in Fast 7, reprising her role as Mia Toretto. This, sadly was her last acting role in a film. She has, however, continued to act on television, most recently appearing in the series Secrets and Lies. Since her breakout role, Brewster has been one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood, and her modeling career has been just as impressive as her work on the big screen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though she can easily rely on her talents, Brewster has bared it all on film, and fans everywhere couldnâ€™t get enough of it. In fact, she has done it&nbsp;several times. The Invisible Circus and Nearing Grace are two examples of Brewster giving fans more than they could have hoped for.</p><h2 id=penelope-cruz---multiple-films><strong>Penelope Cruz - Multiple Films</strong></h2><p>Back in 2001, the film Blow hit theaters, and took the world by storm. It was a massive success, and remains an incredibly popular movie to this very day. This film would serve as a breakout for Spanish actress <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Penelope Cruz</a>, and she has remained a fixture in Hollywood ever since. Her work in film has garnered her with plenty of critical acclaim. Her 2006 film Volver was a critical darling, and Cruz was nominated for an Academy Award for her portrayal of the character Raimunda. Cruz is an immensely talented performer, and is one of the hottest Spanish actresses in the world today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cruz, not unlike the other women on this list, is no stranger to taking it off in her movies, and she has done so on a number of occasions. In fact, Cruz has appeared nude in films in 3 separate decades, and still looks amazing to this very day.</p><h2 id=paz-vega---multiple-foreign-films><strong>Paz Vega - Multiple Foreign Films</strong></h2><p>She may not be a household name like some of the other women on this list, but rest assured that Spanish actress <a href=#>Paz Vega</a> is as beautiful and talented as they come. Her body of work spans nearly 20 years, and her acting career in her native Spain is highly regarded. She has worked with some of the biggest performers in Hollywood, and has maintained a very successful career. Vega also happens to be one of the most beautiful women on the planet, and it should come as no surprise that she has a very strong following. If youâ€™re unfamiliar with Vegaâ€™s acting, I highly suggest you start looking into her body of work.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For her racier appearances, Vega has only done this for foreign films. So, if youâ€™re okay with reading subtitles and enjoying a great film, her work in Spanish movies is where you will find what youâ€™re looking for; a strong acting performance coupled with some racy scenes featuring this gorgeous woman.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqbV2cvLOzxKisrGWclsGqusCsZLCgn2K5psCMrZ%2BeoaJisK2706GcrGWYnsFuwMeeZJ%2Bkn6S%2FcA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f15-gorgeous-latinas-who-let-their-clothes-hit-the-floor.html&text=15%20Gorgeous%20Latinas%20Who%20Let%20Their%20Clothes%20Hit%20The%20Floor&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f15-gorgeous-latinas-who-let-their-clothes-hit-the-floor.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f15-gorgeous-latinas-who-let-their-clothes-hit-the-floor.html&title=15%20Gorgeous%20Latinas%20Who%20Let%20Their%20Clothes%20Hit%20The%20Floor" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f15-gorgeous-latinas-who-let-their-clothes-hit-the-floor.html&title=15%20Gorgeous%20Latinas%20Who%20Let%20Their%20Clothes%20Hit%20The%20Floor" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f15-gorgeous-latinas-who-let-their-clothes-hit-the-floor.html&title=15%20Gorgeous%20Latinas%20Who%20Let%20Their%20Clothes%20Hit%20The%20Floor" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f15-gorgeous-latinas-who-let-their-clothes-hit-the-floor.html&description=15%20Gorgeous%20Latinas%20Who%20Let%20Their%20Clothes%20Hit%20The%20Floor" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./celebrating-diversity-richest-lesbian-actresses.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Celebrating Diversity: Richest Lesbian Actresses">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./youth-wrestler-sucker-punched-after-winning-match-police-investigati.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="                              Youth Wrestler Sucker Punched After Winning Match, Police Investigati">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
