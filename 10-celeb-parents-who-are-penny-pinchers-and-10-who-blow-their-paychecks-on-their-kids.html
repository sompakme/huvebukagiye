From the red carpet events that show celebrities in all of their glittering best to the lavish vacations that only the rich and famous can take, it seems like there is always something to envy. Yet, not all celebrities choose to use their fortune in the same way and that also goes towards how they raise their children. While there are some celebrities that seem to go above and beyond when it comes to doling out a life of extravagance for their kids, there are others that don't feel the same way about allowing their children to live in the lap of luxury.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On a much smaller scale, this is exactly the same for parents outside of the celebrity world. While some parents can't wait to buy their kids the latest designer shoes and throw birthday parties that will be the talk of the Mommy and Me class, there are other parents that force their kids to purchase their toys through their earned allowance through performing chores around the house. This seems to be the equalizer when it comes to comparing the celebrity world with the general public and it's interesting to see how the rich and famous can be alike with regular parents. Check out our list of the 10 celeb parents who blow their fortune on their kids and the 10 who are cheapos and see who you are most like when it comes to raising your kids.</p><h2 id=tyrese-gibson-goes-overboard><strong>Tyrese Gibson Goes Overboard</strong></h2><p>Tyrese Gibson was once considered one of the most talented and successful celebrities in Hollywood, with a thriving acting and singing career. His role in The Fast and the Furious franchise only added to his star appeal and he garnered a new reputation for being a bit outlandish with his spending. Photos of parties in his backyard raised a few eyebrows since he had everything from a personal dry cleaner to a Benihana's restaurant. With him lavishly spending on himself, it shouldn't surprise people that he has been known to truly go overboard for his daughter, Shayla. During an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a> at the GQ's Men of the Year party back in 2015, Gibson was asked about the most lavish gifts he's ever given or received. His response was,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"Well, I just bought my daughter an island."</strong></p><p>Yet, that may not have been the smartest decision since he later started posting online videos about all of his financial problems.</p><h2 id=paul-mccartney-didn-t-pay-for-his-daughter-s-education><strong>Paul McCartney Didn't Pay For His Daughter's Education</strong></h2><p>There are a number of celebrities in Hollywood that have tried to remain grounded when it comes to spending on their kids. Yet, there are some things that almost every celebrity has insisted on splurging on and that's their education. From putting them in the most elite private schools to donating millions of dollars to Ivy League universities, it seems like this is something that a celebrity would be happy to do for their children. Yet, that isn't the case for the former Beatles member, Paul McCartney.</p><p><strong>Despite having accumulated a mass fortune through his role with the Beatles and his solo career, it was reported that he wouldn't spend a dime for his daughter Stella's secondary education.</strong></p><p>She was forced to pay for it herself, even though McCartney has a net worth of an estimated $800 million.</p><h2 id=tyga-outdid-blac-chyna><strong>Tyga Outdid Blac Chyna</strong></h2><p>Back when Tyga was dating Kylie Jenner, the public couldn't get over the sloppiness regarding the fact that he had a child with Blac Chyna and she had started a relationship with Rob Kardashian. With all of the romances intertwining, it just seemed like major dysfunction. This was made even more apparent when Tyga and Blac Chyna's child, King Cairo, turned 4 years old and there were separate birthday parties held by each of the parents.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Blac Chyna had thrown a really great birthday party for King Cairo and the very next day, Tyga threw a bash that put it to shame.</strong></p><p>They called it a $3 million birthday bash, with pricey sports cars throughout the event. Yet, his decision to blow a fortune just to show up Blac Chyna may not have been the best idea since he has since gone through various legal troubles because of failure to pay rent at various properties.</p><h2 id=mark-zuckerberg-keeps-it-simple><strong>Mark Zuckerberg Keeps It Simple</strong></h2><p>There aren't many 33-year-olds that can claim to be as successful as Mark Zuckerberg, or have the bank account figures as him. As the founder of Facebook, Zuckerberg has built a fortune that would require generations upon generations to spend. His estimated net worth is $50 billion and that would seem like an amount that would allow him to have the most lavish birthday parties for his children than anyone could ever imagine. Yet, that isn't the case for Zuckerberg and his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Instead, they've taken to social media to post photos of the birthday celebration for their child, Max, and people couldn't help but notice how low key the event was.</strong></p><p>Not only was it a far cry from any other celebrity kids' birthday party but it seemed like just an ordinary cake inside their home.</p><h2 id=taylor-armstrong-is-criticized-for-spending-too-much><strong>Taylor Armstrong Is Criticized For Spending Too Much</strong></h2><p>When Taylor Armstrong was first introduced to the public through the reality series, The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, the audience was trying to see more of her personality. Yet, she seemed to only be known as the woman that spent far too much on her daughter's birthday party.</p><p><strong>When her daughter turned 4 years old, she spent $60,000 on the birthday party and it was filmed for an episode of the show.</strong></p><p>From the over-the-top decorations to the lavish party favors, it seemed like something that was far too much for a 4-year-old. She was heavily criticized for it but the real criticism came after the death of her husband and the revelation that she was going through major financial issues. Perhaps if she would have saved some of that money rather than spent it, she wouldn't have found herself in such a deep financial hole.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jude-law-is-definitely-not-father-of-the-year><strong>Jude Law Is Definitely Not Father Of The Year</strong></h2><p>Jude Law is a hugely successful actor that has branched out to be considered far more than just famous in the UK. He's starred in a number of memorable films throughout his career, from The Talented Mr. Ripley to Cold Mountain. Yet, he hasn't seemed to have the same sort of success when it comes to his personal life. His union with Sienna Miller was extremely damaging to his public persona due to all of the cheating allegations and he soon became the butt of everyone's joke when it came to cheating with the nanny. When he famously had a child with Samantha Burke, he wasn't winning any father of the year awards when it was revealed that the agreement he made was to pay $5,000 a month and would only see his daughter twice a year. It doesn't look like his daughter will be getting quality time or any shopping sprees with Dad anytime soon.</p><h2 id=tori-spelling-and-dean-mcdermott-got-less-than-they-thought><strong>Tori Spelling And Dean McDermott Got Less Than They Thought</strong></h2><p>Tori Spelling grew up in the lap of luxury as the only daughter of Candy and Aaron Spelling so it shouldn't be surprising to learn that she has had some difficulties in learning how to budget her money. Candy Spelling had a bit of a strained relationship with her daughter because she didn't agree with the way she spent money.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>She often commented on how Tori was able to drop $60,000 in one store while her father was still alive and she hinted that her wild spending habits were one of the reasons why Aaron only left her $800,000 in his will.</strong></p><p>Yet, that hasn't stopped Tori from having numerous kids and throwing over-the-top birthday parties for all of them as if she didn't have a care in the world. This has often put her into difficult situations since she's previously defaulted on loans and had trouble paying for her children's school tuition.</p><h2 id=meryl-streep-raised-her-kids-like-normies><strong>Meryl Streep Raised Her Kids Like Normies</strong></h2><p>There aren't any women in Hollywood that can boast the same sort of success that Meryl Streep has had throughout her acting career. While other women seem to be getting pushed out to pasture once they reach a certain age, Streep is consistently getting coveted roles and achieving a huge amount of acclaim from the public and in the entertainment industry. With so many hit films in her roster of roles, there's no question that Streep has achieved a huge fortune over the years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Yet, she doesn't seem to be spending it to provide a lavish lifestyle for her kids. On the contrary, Streep has made a number of comments on how she has withheld a lot from her children.</strong></p><p>In a 2008 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Good Housekeeping</a>, she stated, "You can't get spoiled if you do your own ironing."</p><h2 id=mekhi-phifer-lost-his-money><strong>Mekhi Phifer Lost His Money&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Mekhi Phifer was once thought of as an incredibly talented actor since he appeared in a number of memorable films throughout his career. He's had a thriving career that features hit films like 8 Mile and the Divergent franchise. Although he's managed to keep his name mostly out of the headlines when compared to other more dynamic actors, that doesn't mean that he lives quietly without any extravagance. Kevin Hart famously referenced his close friendship with Phifer in a stand-up performance and talked about when he was invited to a trip to Disneyland park for a birthday party hosted by the actor.</p><p><strong>Phifer had rented the entire park for the birthday party and Kevin Hart seemed blown away by that amount of extravagance.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yet, those spending splurges may be a bit of a regret for Phifer since he filed bankruptcy in 2014 due to owing back taxes to the tune of $1.2 million and spending over $4,000 more than he was bringing in.</p><h2 id=50-cent-didn-t-even-go-to-his-son-s-grad><strong>50 Cent Didn't Even Go To His Son's Grad</strong></h2><p>Ever since 50 Cent released his first studio album, he's maintained the persona of being the typical baller when it comes to spending like a rap artist. He's often seen in his social media posts with piles of cash and he doesn't hesitate to roll around town in the flashiest cars, sporting diamond chains and watches. Yet, he's not exactly seen as the most generous person when it comes to his children. In fact, many people have criticized him for his treatment of his son Marquise Jackson since all of their personal issues have played out on the Internet.</p><p><strong>50 Cent has claimed to disown his own son and didn't even attend his high school graduation.</strong></p><p>While other celebrities have shown off the lavish gifts they've bestowed on their children for their graduations, 50 Cent is fine with acknowledging the fact that Marquise didn't get anything for graduating high school.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=beyonc-and-jay-z-might-not-be-as-rich-as-we-think><strong>Beyoncé And Jay-Z Might Not Be As Rich As We Think</strong></h2><p>With Beyoncé and Jay-Z being thought of as two of the most influential artists in the music industry, people shouldn't bat an eye when it comes to their spending habits. Both of them are platinum-selling artists and they have had world tours that have sold out the biggest arenas.</p><p><strong>Yet, their spending habits have started to make people wonder about their finances, especially with all of the news about the financial difficulties surrounding Jay-Z's failing Tidal music streaming endeavor.</strong></p><p>The couple has been known to spend lavishly on themselves, whether it's the private island Jay-Z bought for Beyoncé for one of her birthdays to the private jets that could choke a horse with its price tag. It shouldn't come as a surprise that the couple would spend lavishly on their children but the reported $1.3 million that they paid to rent out the entire floor at the Lenox Hill hospital for Blue Ivy Carter's birth seems a bit over the top.</p><h2 id=david-and-victoria-beckham-should-be-more-frugal><strong>David And Victoria Beckham Should Be More Frugal</strong></h2><p>David Beckham is seen as one of the world's most successful athletes of all time and his marriage to Victoria (Posh Spice) has only amplified his star appeal. When the couple moved to the United States with their family, they were welcomed with open arms by the other A-listers in America. With an amazing net worth of over $330 million, it shouldn't be surprising that the couple has a tendency to splurge on their children. Harper's iCandy Peach stroller cost $900 and the couple reportedly spent $20,000 on a tree house for Brooklyn, Cruz, and Romeo.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>While this all seems fine enough for celebrity kids, it takes on a different perception when considering the fact that Victoria Beckham's clothing line is constantly taking a loss. In 2015, her clothing line had a deficit of $4.7 million and 2016 had a deficit that was 78 percent higher.</strong></p><p>The couple may want to tamper down their spending if they are going to continue living the celebrity lifestyle.</p><h2 id=angelina-jolie-shops-at-target><strong>Angelina Jolie Shops At Target</strong></h2><p>There was a time when Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt seemed like they had it all, as one of the most illustrious couples in Hollywood. While there were still people that remained critical of their relationship because of the fact that he was married to Jennifer Aniston while they started their romance, people seemed to be won over by Jolie's philanthropy work and the couple's propensity towards adoption. Yet, it did raise a few eyebrows when the couple started spending lavishly on their children in ways that seemed a little over the top.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a> reported that the couple was spending $10 million per year on their kids and even spent $7,000 for a private boat for the 7th birthday for their son Pax.</strong></p><p>Now that the couple has split, it's no wonder that Angelina has been spotted shopping at Target. It seems like there might not be any money left over for the personal assistants anymore now that reality has started to hit home.</p><h2 id=candy-spelling-spent-it-all><strong>Candy Spelling Spent It All</strong></h2><p>While Tori Spelling seems to be fine with splurging thousands of dollars at each of her kids' birthday parties and living far above her means, the same cannot be said for her mother, Candy. After the death of Aaron Spelling, it was Candy that received the bulk of his fortune and the claim to his amazing estate.</p><p><strong>Tori and her brother reportedly only received $800,000 and by the reports of Tori's financial struggles, it would seem like that money has already been spent.</strong></p><p>In the meantime, people close to Tori have given multiple interviews to the media about how Tori has asked her friends for financial help to pay off her loans and credit card minimums but her mother, Candy, hasn't stepped in at all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mariah-carey-dates-rich><strong>Mariah Carey Dates Rich</strong></h2><p>When Mariah Carey first started out in the music industry, she was seen as an ultra-talented artist that had vocal skills unlike anyone else. She had a huge amount of success early on in her career and her marriage to the music mogul, Tommy Mottola, seemed to build up a particular sort of lifestyle of lavish spending and opulence. She became known as a major diva that loved to splurge on herself and everyone still remembers her infamous episode of the hit MTV series, Cribs.</p><p><strong>That same sort of spending has carried over to her children, Monroe and Moroccan, and she reportedly spent $250,000 on a state-of-the-art Bose system just for them. While her net worth seems to say that she still has plenty to spend, people have started to wonder after she filed a lawsuit against her ex-fiancé, James Packer.</strong></p><p>Even though the two were never married, she wanted money for the pain and suffering and loss of income she reported while dating him. This sort of behavior doesn't seem appropriate for someone that is supposedly secure with their own financial situation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=britney-spears-has-no-control-over-her-money><strong>Britney Spears Has No Control Over Her Money&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Britney Spears was once thought of as one of the hottest and most successful artists in pop music. She was at the top of the charts with back-to-back hit singles and she was the most sought-after pop artists in the world. Yet, it has been quite some time since her heyday and the public has seen her go through some major difficulties since then. There were rumors about substance abuse, various photos of her stumbling out of Hollywood hotspots and then there were some mental health issues that affected her in the worst way. She no longer had full custody of her children and she was no longer able to handle her own finances. There were a number of reports showing that she was spending lavishly on her kids, from matching custom-made electric cars to huge spending sprees. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a> reported that as of April 2017,</p><p><strong>Britney still doesn't have control over her own money and is dependent on her father, Jamie Spears, to dole out whatever she might need.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Perhaps this is a way to alleviate the stress that can come from having to pay your own bills but many people think it's to keep her from overspending beyond her means.</p><h2 id=gordon-ramsay-ships-his-kids-to-economy><strong>Gordon Ramsay Ships His Kids To Economy</strong></h2><p>Gordon Ramsay is one of the most successful chefs on television since he seems to constantly be featured on various reality shows. Whether he's taping a season of Hell's Kitchen, teaching home cooks how to be a real chef or fixing up a hotel, it seems like he's constantly receiving new income. Yet, that doesn't mean that he's willing to blow his entire fortune on his kids. During an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Telegraph</a>,</p><p><strong>Ramsay spoke out about how his children haven't earned the right to sit in first class with him and his wife. Instead, he makes them fly in economy class and doesn't feel bad in the least.</strong></p><p>During the interview, he was quoted as saying, "Make sure those little ones don't come anywhere near us, I want to sleep on this plane!"</p><h2 id=sarah-jessica-parker-wants-to-be-like-her-mom><strong>Sarah Jessica Parker Wants To Be Like Her Mom&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>While other celebrities have been known to treat their kids like miniature rock stars, that definitely isn't the case with Sarah Jessica Parker. She's often photographed walking with her kids like any other ordinary mother and you won't be catching her ordering chauffeur-driven limousines for her kids anytime soon. During a 2016 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> magazine, Parker made it clear that she is intending on keeping spending at a minimum when it comes to her children. During the interview, she stated,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"I think my mother is sorry that there were things she couldn't give us, but I work hard to be as depriving to my children as my mother was, meaning I like to withhold things from my children."</strong></p><p>She may be fine with spending lavishly on her couture gowns and diamonds but she won't be doing the same for her kids.</p><h2 id=lisa-vanderpump-keeps-the-money-to-herself><strong>Lisa Vanderpump Keeps The Money To Herself</strong></h2><p>Lisa Vanderpump is considered one of the most successful cast members on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills because she has been able to maintain a successful chain of restaurants and lounges. While other women seem to be dependent on their husband's money, Vanderpump has solidified herself as a formidable individual in business.</p><p><strong>Yet, that doesn't mean that she's willing to spend all of her earnings on her children. In fact, she's been known to be extremely hard on her kids when it comes to doling out cash.</strong></p><p>During one infamous episode, Vanderpump claimed that she didn't care if her son's electricity was shut off and she refused to pitch in to pay it. Her son, Max, can be seen on episodes of the spin-off series, Vanderpump Rules, and she's often ordering him around as the busboy and bartender as if he's just another worker.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ashton-kutcher-and-mila-kunis-don-t-spoil-their-kids><strong>Ashton Kutcher And Mila Kunis Don't Spoil Their Kids</strong></h2><p>The public was absolutely overjoyed to hear that Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher were finally a romantic couple since they still remembered them from the characters they portrayed on That '70s Show. Once the couple started to have children, it seemed like all was right with the world. Yet, they had to endure a huge amount of criticism when they started to speak out about how they were going to raise their family.</p><p><strong>Kunis gave a number of statements about how they were against nannies for their kids and some people felt like it was a criticism against working mothers and all of the millions of people around the world that didn't have the financial means to just stop working to raise their kids.</strong></p><p>The couple endured even more criticism when they said that they were not going to be giving their kids any presents, even for birthdays and Christmas.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmhpYGKwprjEm2SpmaKau7W%2FjLCfqGWRp7JuvMSnpbJloJ67pLTEq6pmmZ6ZenJ8jLCfqGWSoby4edOhnKKqXaWuuq%2FHnpqkq12ku27Ax56gq2WbnrG0ew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f10-celeb-parents-who-are-penny-pinchers-and-10-who-blow-their-paychecks-on-their-kids.html&text=10%20Celeb%20Parents%20Who%20Are%20Penny%20Pinchers%20And%2010%20Who%20Blow%20Their%20Paychecks%20On%20Their%20Kids&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-celeb-parents-who-are-penny-pinchers-and-10-who-blow-their-paychecks-on-their-kids.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-celeb-parents-who-are-penny-pinchers-and-10-who-blow-their-paychecks-on-their-kids.html&title=10%20Celeb%20Parents%20Who%20Are%20Penny%20Pinchers%20And%2010%20Who%20Blow%20Their%20Paychecks%20On%20Their%20Kids" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f10-celeb-parents-who-are-penny-pinchers-and-10-who-blow-their-paychecks-on-their-kids.html&title=10%20Celeb%20Parents%20Who%20Are%20Penny%20Pinchers%20And%2010%20Who%20Blow%20Their%20Paychecks%20On%20Their%20Kids" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f10-celeb-parents-who-are-penny-pinchers-and-10-who-blow-their-paychecks-on-their-kids.html&title=10%20Celeb%20Parents%20Who%20Are%20Penny%20Pinchers%20And%2010%20Who%20Blow%20Their%20Paychecks%20On%20Their%20Kids" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-celeb-parents-who-are-penny-pinchers-and-10-who-blow-their-paychecks-on-their-kids.html&description=10%20Celeb%20Parents%20Who%20Are%20Penny%20Pinchers%20And%2010%20Who%20Blow%20Their%20Paychecks%20On%20Their%20Kids" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./15-best-tinted-lip-balms.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Best Tinted Lip Balms">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./young-jeezy-clears-the-air-on-rick-ross-fight-and-gucci-mane-s-comments.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Young Jeezy Clears the Air on Rick Ross Fight and Gucci Manes Comments">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
