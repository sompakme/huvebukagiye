She even has her own fanbase. This dancer/actress has been working hard in the industry proving to the world that she can handle things all on her own. She has found success through many different areas in the entertainment industry. She started off as a dancer before she made her way into the movie industry. That was where she ended up meeting Channing after all! They co-starred together in the movie Step Up, and that was the beginning of their love story. It actually wasn’t very long before they were married and started their own family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But that wasn’t enough for Jenna- she wanted to take over the world as well, and she’s certainly well on her way. She is known to be wildly friendly and has no problem speaking her mind on social media. But on the other hand, she is also very private and protects the things that are most important to her. The reason why fans love her so much is because she is genuine and charming- never mind the fact that she’s drop-dead gorgeous. You may think that you know this beauty, but there are so many things you just don’t know. She’s not the kind of girl to stand in her husband's shadow- we're pretty sure she wants to present a shadow of her own. Check out these 15 fun facts about our favorite celeb of the moment, Jenna Dewan-Tatum.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=15-she-wants-to-erase-her-first-drinking-experience><strong>15. She Wants To Erase Her First Drinking Experience</strong></h2><p>I can certainly relate to Jenna’s experience; I really think that we all can. I mean who really has a great experience their first time drinking? I think we all underestimate the effect of alcohol on a body that’s just not used to it. We often go a little heavier than we should and before we know it we are hanging over the porcelain God. The first time Jenna tried drinking was in high school. “My first go at drinking did not go so well. [Laughs.] I ended up getting sick in front of everybody. You know that Ginuwine song “Pony?” It was playing at the party while I was getting sick. My entire senior year, everyone sang that around me. For a year. I would like that erased from my memory.” We can probably all agree that was a humiliating experience, definitely more so than the experience I had myself as a teenager.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=14-she-s-a-friend-to-the-lizard><strong>14. She’s A Friend To The Lizard</strong></h2><p>There are many celebrities that promote certain causes and Jenna is no different. Some celebrities support PETA and go to rallies against the use of fur, or horns or whatever. In Jenna’s case, she has a soft spot for lizards of all shapes and sizes. She believes strongly that the fashion industry should not be using reptile skin in any way shape or form. At one point she painted her body like a snake and paraded herself around at a few events. She wanted to make it clear to the world that there was an issue. She wanted the world to know that it was not okay to use lizard, snake, alligator or crocodile skin for use in the fashion industry at all. She doesn’t believe that the fashion industry should be using these skins in this day and age. She’s looking for a change in the industry, and she's okay with making her opinion known.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=13-she-s-been-to-neverland-ranch><strong>13. She’s Been To Neverland Ranch</strong></h2><p>Of course, she’s been to Neverland Ranch! She’s best buds with Janet Jackson. Well, maybe not best buds, but she was the backup dancer for her, and that goes a long way. They must have been close to some degree because she was invited to go to Neverland Ranch for a party. We are totally willing to admit that we are completely jealous about it. Especially now that<a href=#> Michael</a> has passed and the Ranch just isn’t the same. When she arrived at the party, there was plenty of dancing involved, and she jumped right in. A party at the Neverland Ranch must have been a real surreal experience. She would have had the opportunity to meet Michael as well. How cool would that have been? For such a young girl she was able to experience a lot in the industry, and she’s a lucky girl for it.</p><h2 id=12-shooting-music-videos><strong>12. Shooting Music Videos</strong></h2><p>You would think that shooting music videos would be glamorous and so much fun to do, but Jenna doesn’t feel that way. She has appeared in a few videos as a dancer and has attributed her success to the fact that she was in two of Janet Jackson’s videos. After she was in the videos Janet asked her to go on tour with her and that gave her even more experience. As much as Jenna liked the experience she wasn’t a big fan of shooting videos. She once stated: “Music videos are notoriously long, not fun, grueling. You are known there as a dancer, and it’s kind of sad because dancers, in a lot of ways, are under-appreciated and kind of under-respected when it comes to that, so they don’t necessarily treat you in a nice way when you do a music video.” We would always treat Jenna well, that's for sure.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=11-she-s-a-vegan><strong>11. She’s A Vegan</strong></h2><p>Being a vegan is not an easy decision for anyone. In fact, I couldn’t imagine doing it even for one day! But vegans have strong opinions about eating animals, and when it comes right down to it, they don’t see it as a big sacrifice. Jenna has always been known to have an insane body, and a lot of that is attributed to the fact that she’s a dancer. She, however, believes that it also has to do with her vegan diet- one which keeps her pretty lean. She originally planned on being a vegetarian but eventually she switched to being a vegan because she’s a strong animal rights supporter. She said, “after going vegan, I felt so much better. My skin cleared up; I had a ton of more energy and I just felt clearer in the head.” She tried to get Channing on board as well, but he only lasted a few months before giving up on it. In the meantime, the two of them are raising their daughter as a vegetarian and eventually they will allow her to make a choice for herself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-she-s-serious-about-meditation><strong>10. She’s Serious About Meditation</strong></h2><p>This girl is an amazing dancer for a few reasons: she eats right and maintains a killer body so that she can do the strenuous work involved in being a dancer. She’s also a strong believer in living a healthy lifestyle for many different reasons. That’s not all she does, however; she believes that you need the right energy to do well as a dancer. She believes strongly in Vedic meditation and crystal energy. She carries rose quartz in her gym bag to make sure her energy is already aligned. In fact, she brings these items wherever she travels. “Every hotel room, every apartment we rent, I am sage-ing. And I have crystals that I travel with. It just makes me feel better.” It probably gives her the right peace of mind so that she can stay focused as an artist. I’ve always believed that mediation is key to a positive mindset as well. Good for you Jenna!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=9-she-visited-naughty-clubs-with-janet-jackson><strong>9. She Visited Naughty&nbsp;Clubs With Janet Jackson</strong></h2><p>Imagine being a backup dancer and going to strip clubs with <a href=#>Janet Jackson</a>? The whole experience would be very surreal, I would imagine. Just having Janet invite you out to&nbsp;the strip club with her would be a hilarious situation to be in. When Jenna Dewan-Tatum started her career, she worked for Janet Jackson as a backup dancer- that was her first real gig. She was only 19-years old at the time and after the gigs were over the whole crew used to go to the strip club. I didn’t realize that Janet had such an affinity for strip clubs, but there you have it. Jenna had quite the experiences while she was learning how to make it in the industry. She also made a great career move for herself. After all, think about it, she can say she had&nbsp;Janet Jackson as her first boss; that must have opened a lot of doors for the talented dancer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=8-her-favorite-activity-is-riding-her-bike><strong>8. Her Favorite Activity Is Riding Her Bike</strong></h2><p>There are many different ways that we all find to relax and regroup in our lives. We either choose to exercise or read, spend time with friends, or go on vacation. It all depends&nbsp;what floats your boat. For Jenna, it’s riding her bike, and her favorite place to do that is&nbsp;on&nbsp;Nantucket. She literally takes a bike out and goes for a ride. Her family has a house there, and it’s been in the family for many generations. She loves going there and spending the time to relax, and bike riding is one way she is able to unwind. “My family has had a house on Nantucket for many generations, and one of my favorite things to do is to ride my bike there. I'm still amazed there aren't any spotlights on the entire island!” It sounds like a fantastic place to visit. Although I'm not sure what spotlights have to do with it- maybe Jenna prefers midnight riding?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=7-she-was-very-popular-in-high-school><strong>7. She Was Very Popular In High School</strong></h2><p>Considering the outgoing and charming personality that she has it’s no surprise that Jenna was one of the popular kids in school. You kind of have to be outgoing if you are going to be part of the “cool” kids. She actually moved around a lot while she was growing up because her parents' careers forced them to move. It didn’t seem to affect how well she made friends in multiple schools, however. When she was in Maryland, she attended Notre Dame Preparatory School and was the head cheerleader. It’s not surprising since cheerleading can easily tie into dancing as well. From there she moved to Texas and attended Grapevine High School where she was also a cheerleader. During her senior year in 1999, she had the honor of being voted the prom queen by&nbsp;her peers. From cheerleader to prom queen it’s not surprising that this beautiful girl charmed everyone around her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=6-she-likes-to-go-out-makeup-free><strong>6. She Likes To Go Out Makeup Free</strong></h2><p>She may be the only female in the world willing to do it but look at the girl- she’s absolutely stunning no matter what! I can’t say that I would be willing to go out without makeup and it’s not because I’m a barking car chaser; I just like the creative things you can do with makeup. Jenna loves going out without makeup and apparently she does it quite frequently. There is one thing she won’t leave the house without doing, and that’s curling her lashes. We ladies all know there is one thing that will make your eyes pop, and that’s a great set of lashes. That may be her one big beauty secret. I personally hate the lash curler; I believe it was invented as a torture device. Jenna’s reason for curling her lashes is because she says it makes her "look more awake.” Whatever works for you, Jenna!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=5-she-used-to-date-justin-timberlake><strong>5. She Used To Date Justin Timberlake</strong></h2><p>It’s true that she has dated many celebrity men, not just her husband Channing Tatum. In 2000, she was dating <a href=#>Justin Timberlake</a>; they met because she was one of his backup dancers. While he was part of the band NSYNC, she was dancing with his crew, and it wasn’t long before the two were dating. But her famous entanglements don’t end there; she was also linked with Shane West from A Walk to Remember. Both relationships didn’t last obviously, and everything changed for her in 2005 when she met her husband in the movie Step Up. They were together for a few years before they became engaged. Channing has stated on more than one occasion that he was quite taken by the beautiful actress. They married in 2009, but&nbsp;it took them four years before they started their family. The couple has never been happier, and you can see that they have quite the spark between them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=4-she-had-some-drama-with-britney-spears><strong>4. She Had Some Drama With Britney Spears</strong></h2><p>There was some obvious tension between her and <a href=#>Britney Spears</a> in 2002 because Britney was still torn up about her breakup with Justin. I’m sure Britney even believed that she would marry Justin one day. So she was none too pleased to find out that Justin was now dating Jenna; especially since they started dating so soon after the breakup. The drama started when Britney showed up at&nbsp;a nightclub to find Justin there with Jenna. A confrontation broke out when Britney started engaging in a dance-off with the pair. Most would think that was an embarrassing display, but that’s Hollywood for you. I’m not sure who won the dance off, but it’s safe to assume that it didn’t go over well for Britney either way- she never did get back together with Justin.</p><h2 id=3-she-loves-the-flea-market><strong>3. She Loves The Flea Market</strong></h2><p>There is just something about the flea market that can make for a relaxing day. It’s a great way to find new stuff&nbsp;for your home, especially if you are into vintage items. There are just some things you can’t find anywhere else. I love spending the day at a flea market because you never know what you’ll find. Jenna Tatum seems to feel exactly the same way. She loves nothing more than a good flea market, and it’s one of her go-tos when she has the day off. I can just imagine the items she is able to get together for their home. When a celebrity loves something as simple as a flea market you know that they are truly down to earth; someone that you can hang out with without all the airs! Who knows, she just might be one cool chick to hang out with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=2-she-has-a-crush-on-justin-bieber><strong>2. She Has A Crush On Justin Bieber</strong></h2><p>Well, who doesn’t right? It seems like half the female population and maybe some of the male as well just can’t get enough of Justin. You would think with such a handsome husband at home that her eyes wouldn’t stray, but she has confessed to&nbsp;<a href=#>Ellen DeGeneres</a> that she and her friends have a massive crush on the Biebs. Once during a girl’s night out they all got together for dinner and while the place was mainly empty it did have a piano. Suddenly to their surprise someone got up and started playing it. It didn’t take them long to realize that it was, in fact, Justin himself and they went nuts over it: “My one girlfriend brought out her lipstick; my one girl is doing her hair. We all completely fangirled out, and we’re all, mind you, married with, like, 1.5 kids, so we turned immediately 16.” Whatever floats your boat Jenna!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=1-she-has-famous-friends><strong>1. She Has Famous Friends</strong></h2><p>Well, I suppose the girl has been in the business long enough to have acquired some famous friends, right? She does, after all, have Janet Jackson in her back pocket. Not to mention Jenna is one cool chick! During&nbsp;her career in the industry, she has become best friends with <a href=#>Hilary Duff </a>and <a href=#>Emmanuelle Chriqui</a>. She has also met many famous peeps through her husband in addition to those she knows from&nbsp;her dancing days. Emmanuelle actually stood up at&nbsp;her wedding when she became Channing’s wife. Not only that but Hilary Duff also served as a bridesmaid. I guess it just goes to show how many great people you can meet when you are hobnobbing with the snobs. Just kidding- it would be a blast to party with some of these amazing people.
