At the start, many doubted the project, heck <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Aniston</a></strong> was told that the spot on the sitcom would not be her big break... ouch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">’Friends’ Reunion Might Have Never Happened If It Hadn’t Been For This Actor</a></span></p><p>The show thrived for ten seasons while the cast got very rich. In truth, the show could've lasted another ten years, given all the fanfare. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The reunion on HBO</a> proved the cast is still relevant, and that won't change any time soon.</p><p>Throughout its lengthy run, fans have made many observations. One, in particular, is a questionable friendship between two of the main stars on the show. Fans discussed the friendship on Quora, providing reasons as to why the two weren't as close compared to some of the others.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As it turns out, one can argue <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the two weren't as close behind the scenes</a> either. One of the stars recently admitted that she didn't realize how hard things were for her fellow co-worker behind the scenes when he didn't get a laugh on the show. That had some questioning their friendship off-camera as well.</p><p>Let's take a look at which stars the fans are referring to.</p><h2 id=i-don-t-hear-from-anyone>"I Don't Hear From Anyone"</h2><p>The relationship in question is between none other than Rachel and Chandler. Before we delve into their friendship on-screen, let's highlight their relationship as Jennifer Aniston and Matthew Perry, off-camera.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans React to Jennifer Aniston Opening Up About Matthew Perry's Mental Health</a></span></p><p>During the reunion, Lisa Kudrow was all smiles explaining how close everyone is.</p><p>"We stay in touch for sure," she said. "Maybe not every day, but, you know, we have such a bond from having done this show and forged this very tight relationship that anytime you text or call someone, they're gonna pick up. They'll be there."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Perry wasn't buying it, jokingly saying, "I don't hear from anyone."</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew would also make some serious comments</a> pertaining to his struggles off the set when he didn't get a laugh.</p><p>"To me, I felt like I was going to die if they didn't laugh. And it's not healthy, for sure," he told his castmates.</p><p>"But I would sometimes say a line and they wouldn't laugh and I would sweat and just go into convulsions. If I didn't get the laugh I was supposed to get, I would freak out."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The closeness between Aniston and Perry was questioned when Jen came out stating that she didn't realize his struggles.</p><p>"I didn't understand the level of anxiety and self-torture (that) was put on Matthew Perry, if he didn't get that laugh, and the devastation that he felt."</p><p>On the screen, fans are talking about Chandler and Rachel's relationship. According to fan theories, they were the least close of the bunch.</p><h2 id=the-distant-friends>The Distant Friends</h2><p>Search for 'Chandler and Rachel' and one of the first things to come up, is their somewhat awkward relationship, "Why were Chandler and Rachel distant in Friends?"</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This ‘Friends’ Fan Theory Says Monica Cheated On Chandler</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans have several different theories</a> as to why the two weren't as close throughout their time on the show, especially compared to others.</p><p>"Everybody knows Chandler and Joey were the closest Friends among all, Also Rachel was the last person to join the group. So definitely Chandler`s closeness with Rachel was not as same as that of Joey, Ross, Monica and Phoebe. But even then they were very close friends almost like others."</p><p>Other fans blame it on the fact that Chandler just had a weird history with women in general.</p><p>"Chandler was always awkward with women. Perhaps that's why he never could develop close one to one friendship with any of the girls, except Monica who was his soul mate and so destiny had to but bring them together."</p><p>Not everyone believes that the two weren't close.</p><p>'The One With The Two Parties' along with 'The One Where Rachel Quits' are some obvious examples of their love for one another.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A fan&nbsp;believes their friendship was just different in nature.</p><p>"Overall, I believe the perceived distance between them is simply because they have such a great friendship, where their love for one another is purely platonic."</p><p>"In a show that consists mostly of romantic affairs, their bond may seem distanced whereas really it is a good friendship."</p><p>We'll leave that one entirely up to 'Friends' fans and how they perceived the show. Some fans loved the type of relationship the two had, while others feel as though it wasn't close compared to the rest of the group.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Aniston Reveals Which Clothes She Stole From The 'Friends' Set (Not Rachel's!)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: Quora, Twitter, YouTube & Too Fab</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidq6GVo7G0ecWapaxlpJ22r7eMrZ%2Beq5Viwbi7jKaYoqZdmLWivsCcq56qo2K1orCMrZ%2BeZZ2kwLV5w6KqrZmeqXqzscuaq6Knnqi1qryMppitrJiaxG68xKupsmWamruvtcWeqWaZnp7AtbvNaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffriends-fans-think-these-two-main-characters-had-the-most-distant-relationship.html&text=%27Friends%27%20Fans%20Think%20These%20Two%20Main%20Characters%20Had%20The%20Most%20Distant%20Relationship&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffriends-fans-think-these-two-main-characters-had-the-most-distant-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffriends-fans-think-these-two-main-characters-had-the-most-distant-relationship.html&title=%27Friends%27%20Fans%20Think%20These%20Two%20Main%20Characters%20Had%20The%20Most%20Distant%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffriends-fans-think-these-two-main-characters-had-the-most-distant-relationship.html&title=%27Friends%27%20Fans%20Think%20These%20Two%20Main%20Characters%20Had%20The%20Most%20Distant%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffriends-fans-think-these-two-main-characters-had-the-most-distant-relationship.html&title=%27Friends%27%20Fans%20Think%20These%20Two%20Main%20Characters%20Had%20The%20Most%20Distant%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffriends-fans-think-these-two-main-characters-had-the-most-distant-relationship.html&description=%27Friends%27%20Fans%20Think%20These%20Two%20Main%20Characters%20Had%20The%20Most%20Distant%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./20-real-life-wrestling-scumbags-fans-can-t-help-but-hate.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="20 Real-Life Wrestling Scumbags Fans Can't Help But Hate">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./wholesome-brendan-fraser-moments-that-show-why-fans-love-him.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Wholesome Brendan Fraser Moments That Show Why Fans Love Him">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
