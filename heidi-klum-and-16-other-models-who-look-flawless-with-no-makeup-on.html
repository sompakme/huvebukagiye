Today, it's time to see what some of them look like without any makeup on. Spoiler alert - you are going to be extremely jealous! It’s safe to say that all of these pretty women have incredibly soft and glowy skin, as well as amazing facial features, eyelashes, and eyebrows — they kind of have the whole package.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From ladies who have been in the industry for a while, such as Cindy Crawford and Gisele Bundchen, to new but iconic models, such as Bella Hadid and Kendall Jenner, this list is filled with beautiful ladies showing off their amazing, bare-faced selfies.</p><p>Alright, now here they are - Heidi Klum and 16 other models who were spotted looking flawless with absolutely no makeup on!</p><h2 id=let-s-start-off-with-chrissy-teigen-cuddling-her-dog-in-bed><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>Let's Start Off With&nbsp;Chrissy Teigen Cuddling Her Dog In Bed</span></h2><p>To kick our list off, we decided to go with Chrissy Teigen, who shared this adorable selfie of her cuddling with her dog in bed. As you can tell, Chrissy is rocking comfy PJs and she looks pretty much bare-faced, but her skin is absolutely glowing!</p><h2 id=here-s-bella-hadid-giving-us-a-morning-selfie><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>Here's&nbsp;Bella Hadid Giving Us A Morning Selfie</span></h2><p>Next on our list is Bella Hadid, who also decided to take a selfie while still in bed. As you can tell from the photo above, the beautiful brunette pretty much wakes up looking like she already has her foundation on and we are absolutely jealous!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=and-her-sister-gigi-also-likes-taking-selfies-in-pjs><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>And Her Sister Gigi&nbsp;Also Likes Taking Selfies In PJs</span></h2><p>Speaking of Bella Hadid - her older sister, Gigi, obviously also had to make it onto our list. Just like the previous two ladies, Gigi decided to take a candid bedtime selfie and share it with her followers on social media. This is making us all feel super-jealous of her perfect complexion!</p><h2 id=we-re-obsessed-with-kendall-jenner-s-freckles><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>We're Obsessed With Kendall Jenner's Freckles</span></h2><p>This bare-faced selfie that Kendall Jenner took might just be your favorite one on the list - especially if you love Kendall's adorable freckles. If we had these freckles, we would never, ever cover them up with makeup. It seems like Kendall is starting to embrace them as well!</p><h2 id=and-adriana-lima-doesn-t-like-wearing-makeup-on-flights><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>And Adriana Lima Doesn't Like Wearing Makeup On Flights</span></h2><p>Let’s move on to supermodel, Adriana Lima, who has always been known for her natural Brazilian beauty. In the photo above, you can see Adriana rocking zero makeup while on a flight. We all know how annoying it is to travel with makeup on, so why even do it?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=here-s-lily-aldridge-sharing-her-bare-face><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Here's Lily Aldridge Sharing Her Bare Face</span></h2><p>Another pretty face that made it onto our list is Lily Aldridge. Lily took this adorable selfie during a vacation and you can certainly tell that her skin has had plenty of rest. It's also obvious that Lilly is taking amazing care of her complexion! These ladies are models for a reason, so Lily's natural beauty is not a shocker!</p><h2 id=and-gisele-b-ndchen-showing-off-her-natural-beauty><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>And Gisele Bündchen Showing Off Her Natural Beauty</span></h2><p>Next on our list is the one and only Gisele Bündchen, who certainly isn’t a stranger to going to public events without any makeup on. Honestly, she always looks absolutely stunning! What is it with these Brazilian models and their beautiful, naturally glowing skin?</p><h2 id=joan-smalls-can-pose-for-the-camera-without-makeup><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Joan Smalls Can&nbsp;Pose For The Camera Without Makeup</span></h2><p>Another famous model who looks incredible without any makeup on is Joan Smalls. As you can see from the photo above, Joan decided to pose for a selfie while in a car...and we can't believe that this is what she actually wakes up looking like!</p><h2 id=and-here-s-bar-refaeli-at-the-beach><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>And Here's Bar Refaeli At The Beach</span></h2><p>Bar Refaeli certainly also deserves a spot on our list, as she looks incredible without any makeup on her face. The photo above was taken while the beautiful Israeli model was enjoying a tropical vacation. We wish we looked this great at the beach!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=heidi-klum-took-this-pic-before-her-makeup-was-done><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Heidi Klum Took This Pic Before Her Makeup Was Done</span></h2><p>Next on our list is Heidi Klum. She decided to share a photo of what she actually looks like, before her makeup gets done, with her social media followers. Honestly, Heidi looks incredible and if our skin was anything like this we would probably never ever even put makeup on!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">21 Pics Of Heidi Klum’s Transformation</a></span></p><h2 id=and-here-s-karlie-kloss-giving-us-a-bare-faces-kiss><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>And Here's Karlie Kloss Giving Us A Bare-Faces Kiss</span></h2><p>Another model that made it onto our list is the adorable Karlie Kloss, who shared this bare-faced selfie with her fans on social media. To be honest, we need all these models to share their secrets with us - how can their skin look this flawless?</p><h2 id=christy-turlington-also-shared-a-beach-selfie><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Christy Turlington Also Shared A Beach Selfie</span></h2><p>Supermodel Christy Turlington also found her way onto our list...and for good reason. The pretty brunette took this stunning selfie during one of her vacations and her skin just looks incredibly rejuvenated and fresh! We wonder how much time these ladies spend on skincare daily!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=and-jourdan-dunn-is-all-about-that-golden-hour-glow><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>And Jourdan Dunn Is All About That Golden Hour Glow</span></h2><p>Let’s move on to model Jourdan Dunn, who knows that the best time to take selfies - especially if they’re you're bare-faced - is during golden hour.

The pretty blonde definitely looks incredible even without those extremely defined eyebrows and thick eyelashes. That's a makeup trend that is slowly going away, anyway!</p><h2 id=and-so-does-emily-ratajkowski><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>And So Does Emily Ratajkowski</span></h2><p>One model who naturally has standout eyebrows and eyelashes is Emily Ratajkowski, which is why her bare-faced selfie probably looks the most unbelievable. On top of being blessed with amazing brows and lashes, Emily also has incredibly clear and glowing skin — what a lucky girl!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Amazing Facts You Never Knew About Emily Ratajkowski</a></span></p><h2 id=here-s-cara-delevingne-telling-us-to-stay-weird><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Here's Cara Delevingne Telling Us To Stay Weird</span></h2><p>Next on our list is Cara Delevingne, who also shared a selfie while hanging out at a cafe without any makeup on.
