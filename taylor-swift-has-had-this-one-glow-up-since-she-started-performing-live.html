While it seemed that she had found a home in country music, it became clear that Swift did not want to be pigeonholed in just one genre. As such, Swift began the transition from country to pop, with 1989 being the first full-length pop album released.</p><p>When the albums are listened to, Swift has grown not only lyrically but vocally as well. The once sweet voice with a twang has transformed into that of a more mature and seasoned performer. This comes from learning vocal control as well as taking more chances as a performer.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/your-paragraph-text-2023-11-04t101009-305.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Taylor Swift Handled The Boos At Her Friend's Wedding In The Best Way Possible</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift was booed by her own fans at her friend's wedding, but handled it all the right way.</span><p>Because of this, Swift has had a glow-up since she started performing live — a glow-up that is not based on physicality but instead on grit and talent.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-swift-39-s-high-notes-have-gotten-higher-since-her-debut>Taylor Swift's High Notes Have Gotten Higher Since Her Debut</h2><p>When Swift came on the scene, she was 16 years old. At this young age, Swift was not only writing her own songs but she was singing like a seasoned country star as well. There was no criticism of Swift's vocal range for her first album. Critics and fans alike were blown away by her talent.</p><p>As each album progressed, the vocal range that Swift displayed grew. However, so did the criticism of her voice as well as the question of whether Swift really wrote her music. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swift made the decision to hire a vocal coach to help her grow musically</a>, which was beneficial for the Midnights singer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/taylor-swift.jpg><p>"In my darkest moments, I was tormented by the doubts that swirled loudly around my ascent and my merits as an artist," Swift wrote in a letter to her fans about the album Speak Now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I was trying to create a follow-up to the most awarded country album in history while staring directly into the face of intense criticism. I had been widely and publicly slammed for my singing voice and was first encountering the infuriating question that is unfortunately still lobbed at me to this day: does she really write her songs? Spoiler alert: I really, really do."</p><p>Swift went on to say, "I wanted to get better, to challenge myself, and to build on my skills as a writer, an artist, and a performer. I didn't want to just be handed respect and acceptance in my field. I wanted to earn it. To try and confront these demons, I underwent extensive vocal training and made a decision that would completely define this album: I decided I would write it completely on my own."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/how-taylor-swift-is-adding-to-her-current-740-million-net-worth-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>How Taylor Swift Is Adding To Her Current $1.1 Billion Net Worth</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift is a cultural icon and a financial powerhouse in the entertainment industry, who is now in the billionaires club.</span><p>As a result of Swift taking on a vocal coach and making the decision to write her own songs, she has changed musically. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swift's high notes got higher over the years</a> and her lyrical depth increased. But best of all, critics were silenced. The effort proved to be a win for Swift, her music, and her career.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-39-s-lyrical-depth-of-music-has-changed>Taylor Swift's Lyrical Depth Of Music Has Changed</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ttweb_taylor-swift-has-had-this-one-glow-up-since-she-started-performing-live_bk_a2-2.jpg><p>Swift was 16 years old when Taylor Swift was released. As good as the writing was on that album, the emotional maturity was that of a 16-year-old. With each additional album that was released, the lyrical depth changed.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swift showed personal growth from album to album</a>. Essentially, Swift was growing up with her fans and experiencing what they were experiencing, making her relatable to those who were buying her albums.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I think retrospect will tell a lot," Swift explained. "Years from now [and] I'll look back and go, 'I didn't know anything then.'"</p><p>Swift went on to explain, "I had this song called 'Picture to Burn,' that's talking about how 'I hate your truck,' and 'I hate that you ignored me,' 'I hate you.' Now, the way that I would say that and the way that I would feel that kind of pain is a lot different."</p><p>That does not mean that Swift wishes she had done things differently with her writing when she was younger. Quite the contrary, in fact.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/the-one-taylor-swift-song-that-was-making-2c2.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The One Taylor Swift Song That Was Making $84K A Week On Spotify</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift made a fortune off one song alone on Spotify, but still felt the need to pull the song down eventually.</span><p>"I look back on the record I made when I was 16, and I'm so happy I made it," Swift said. "I got to immortalize those emotions that when you're so angry, you hate everything. It's like recording your diary over the years, and that's a gift."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The ability to continue to grow is what has helped Swift be as successful as she is. <a href=#>Fans don't necessarily like all of Swift's songs</a>, of course. But learning what works and what does not is part of the growth process, as is being challenged — something that Swift has chosen to do with The Eras Tour, her most ambitious tour to date.</p><h2 id=eras-tour-is-more-ambitious-than-any-other-tour-taylor-swift-has-done>Eras Tour Is More Ambitious Than Any Other Tour Taylor Swift Has Done</h2><p>Swift has always put on an amazing concert. From the Fearless Tour to the Speak Now World Tour, fans saw huge growth in the scale of production between albums. Then, with the Red Tour, fans were blown away by the evolution in both performing skills and the scale of the performance.</p><p>It became clear with the 1989 Tour and the Reputation Stadium Tour that Swift was a force to be reckoned with when it came to her live performances.</p><p>However, even the biggest of Swifties could not have imagined that the Lavender Haze singer would put together a tour where she was singing 44 songs per concert date, easily making the Eras Tour the most ambitious production Swift has tackled to date.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is no surprise that the <a href=#>Eras Tour had broken records before it was even halfway over</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/taylor-swift-4.jpg><p>To ensure that she hits all the high notes and executes dance moves with ease, Swift does endurance training. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The endurance training that Swift does can vary from running to high-intensity dance cardio</a>. In conjunction, Swift makes sure to eat a meal high in protein several hours before the show and she keeps hydrated.</p><p>In addition to making sure her body can take on three hours of dancing and moving about the stage, Swift cares for her voice. This means resting it before and after performances to keep the vocals strong.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the last almost two decades that Swift has been in the music industry, there has been incredible growth. It is this growth that has allowed her to remain relevant among her fans and in the entertainment industry at large and there is no doubt that when the Eras Tour ends and Swift works on her next album, more growth will be seen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1lpqS2pLGMoZisZZOdrq%2BzxJ1kqK6Vp3q1tcyeZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftaylor-swift-has-had-this-one-glow-up-since-she-started-performing-live.html&text=Taylor%20Swift%20Has%20Had%20This%20One%20Glow-Up%20Since%20She%20Started%20Performing%20Live&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftaylor-swift-has-had-this-one-glow-up-since-she-started-performing-live.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftaylor-swift-has-had-this-one-glow-up-since-she-started-performing-live.html&title=Taylor%20Swift%20Has%20Had%20This%20One%20Glow-Up%20Since%20She%20Started%20Performing%20Live" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftaylor-swift-has-had-this-one-glow-up-since-she-started-performing-live.html&title=Taylor%20Swift%20Has%20Had%20This%20One%20Glow-Up%20Since%20She%20Started%20Performing%20Live" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftaylor-swift-has-had-this-one-glow-up-since-she-started-performing-live.html&title=Taylor%20Swift%20Has%20Had%20This%20One%20Glow-Up%20Since%20She%20Started%20Performing%20Live" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftaylor-swift-has-had-this-one-glow-up-since-she-started-performing-live.html&description=Taylor%20Swift%20Has%20Had%20This%20One%20Glow-Up%20Since%20She%20Started%20Performing%20Live" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./brandon-avery-perlman-wiki-height-weight-age-girlfriend-family-biography-more.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Brandon Avery Perlman Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Girlfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./sway-e-40-too-hort-visit-white-house-with-golden-state-warriors.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sway, E-40, Too $hort Visit White House With Golden State Warriors">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
