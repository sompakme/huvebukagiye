In 2017, Zach married U.S. Women’s Soccer Champion Julie Ertz, and the two started their family foundation together.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-911 data-method=placement-service></span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=zach-ertz-parents></span>Zach Ertz Parents<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Adam Ertz was born and raised by his mother Lisa Ertz and his Douglas Ertz in Orange, California.</strong> The family relocated to Northern California when he was just seven years old, a move that would later have a significant impact on Zach’s evolution as an athlete. He was brought up as the oldest of four children. His father played for the Lehigh University football team from 1981 to 1984. Ironically, in his youth, football was far from Zach’s mind.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span></p><p>The eldest of the four Ertz boys participated in virtually every other sport, from soccer to baseball to swimming. But Zach’s true love from a young age was basketball. He had the size for it right from the beginning. Around the same time, Zach’s family life began to change. His parents divorced during his sophomore year of high school.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-912 data-method=placement-service></span></p><p>Ultimately, it brought him even closer to his mom Lisa, who became his primary caretaker and confidant. As the oldest of the four Ertz boys, Zach also took on a larger role in the house. He and his three younger siblings Shane, Nick, and Jackson still spent time with their father, who lived close by. But their home life revolved around their mother and each other.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=zach-ertz-mother></span>Zach Ertz Mother<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>His mother, Lisa, encouraged Zach to continue to play other sports, and that included giving football another try. Initially, he resisted, worried that his continued growth would put him right back on the offensive line, just as he’d been a few years earlier. Eventually, though, he relented, joining the freshman football team at Monte Vista High School in Danville, California.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=zach-ertz-siblings></span>Zach Ertz Siblings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ertz was born and brought up alongside his three <strong>brothers</strong> Shane Ertz, Nick Ertz, and Jackson Ertz.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-913 data-method=placement-service></span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=zach-ertz-wife></span>Zach Ertz Wife<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Ertz is married to his lovely wife Julie Ertz.</strong> On February 26, 2016, Ertz proposed to professional soccer player Julie Johnston; starting defensive midfielder for the U.S. women’s national team and for the Chicago Red Stars at Klein Field, the Stanford University baseball stadium where they first met. The couple did their wedding on March 26, 2017, in Goleta, California. They were both featured in ESPN The Magazine’s Body Issue 2017.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span></p><p>The flower girl and ring bearer both sported the couple’s jerseys on their walk down the aisle, cappuccinos embossed with footballs and soccer balls were served after the reception and even the cake topper was shaped like a football and soccer ball.“We wanted pops of just us, not just a typical wedding,” Julie told People Magazine.</p><p>“It was definitely a dream come true. It was beautiful, perfect… I wanted to make sure I didn’t miss a moment. It just felt so right.”Her wife is an American soccer player and FIFA Women’s World Cup champion.

Although his football career didn’t take off – he’s now the vice president of worldwide sales at Wind River, software and company – Doug has been one of his son’s biggest supporters.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-915 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span></p><p>“First of all, there’s a sense of relief. I know Zach was going through a stressful time. I think, in Zach’s mindset, he believes he was the best tight end in the draft. I believe time will tell. He thought he would be the first tight end to go, but he didn’t. And I think when the ‘Niners had the chance to pick him but they traded up, that created some gyrations for him.</p><p>There were a lot of things going on that first day, and I know he was really frustrated,” Doug told The Morning Call, just after Zach was drafted in 2013. Zach’s first athletic love was basketball, but it didn’t take long for him to find a place on the football field and he frequently credits his parents for sparking that interest.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=zach-ertz-contract></span>Zach Ertz Contract<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ertz signed a 5 year, $42,500,000 contract with the Philadelphia Eagles, including a $8,000,000 signing bonus, $21,000,000 guaranteed, and an average annual salary of $8,500,000. In 2019, Ertz will earn a base salary of $805,000 and a restructure bonus of $7,195,000, while carrying a cap hit of $6,291,500 and a dead cap value of $17,737,500.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-916 data-method=placement-service></span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=zach-ertz-fantasy></span>Zach Ertz Fantasy<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ertz may be listed as a tight end, but he’s the No. 1 receiver for the Philadelphia Eagles. Only five receivers had more targets than Ertz in 2018, and only Michael Thomas caught more passes. While Ertz did finish a full point per game behind Travis Kelce in PPR, he would have ranked as the No. 10 wide receiver in the format.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span></p><p>He’s one of the few tight ends who should be drafted regardless of whether you have to start one. He’s also a nice consolation prize in the third round if you don’t draft Kelce… The Case Against For some guys it’s really hard to find a case against, so I’m reaching a little bit here. But Ertz does have another talented tight end in Philadelphia in Dallas Goedert, and it’s possible his numbers regress a little off his career year. Also, Nick Foles is gone, so if Carson Wentz suffers yet another injury, Ertz could actually see his production impacted.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=zach-ertz-injury></span>Zach Ertz Injury<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ertz was a limited practice participant Wednesday due to an ankle injury, Zach Berman of The Philadelphia Inquirer reports. He apparently came out of Sunday’s over the Rams with the injury, but his ability to practice in any capacity suggests he should be fine for this weekend’s home date with the Texans.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_9"></span></p><p>While he’s never had any trouble getting volume with Nick Foles at quarterback, Ertz’s per-target production has been better when he’s had Carson Wentz throwing to him. There is cause for optimism in this week’s matchup, as Houston has given up seven touchdowns, 63.5 yards per game, and 8.8 yards per target to tight ends.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-917 data-method=placement-service></span></p><h1 style=text-align:center>Frequently Asked Questions About Zach Ertz</h1><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-zach-ertz></span>Who is Zach Ertz?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Zach Ertz is an acclaimed known American football tight end for the Arizona Cardinals of the National Football League (NFL).</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_10"></span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-old-is-zach-ertz></span>How old is Zach Ertz?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ertz is 31 years old as of 2021, he is an American national who was born on 10 November 1990, in Orange, California, United States.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-tall-is-zach-ertz></span>How tall is Zach Ertz?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ertz stands at a height of 1.96m.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-zach-ertz-married></span>Is Zach Ertz married?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yes, Ertz is married to his lovely wife Julie Ertz.
