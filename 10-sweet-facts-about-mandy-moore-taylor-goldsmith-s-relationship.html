Moore married Ryan Adams in 2009, at a point when Adams was well-established in his career and continuously releasing music, but for Mandy, music took a backseat once she got married.</p><p>After Ryan filed for divorce in 2015, Mandy found herself listening to Dawes, and she let her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fandom be known</a> on Instagram, leading to a connection with Taylor.</p><h2 id=facetime-gave-them-a-glimpse-into-the-future><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>FaceTime Gave Them A Glimpse Into The Future</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2><span class=item-num>17 </span><span></span></h2><p>Falling in love with a touring musician who is constantly traveling definitely requires some wiggle room to be implemented on the road to finding your soulmate.

Happiness inspired by their blossoming romance was also marked by a tinge of sadness.</p><p>Mandy's divorce from Ryan Adams caused a lot of sadness and deep emotional navigation through a tough situation. By the time divorce papers were filed, Mandy had met and connected with Taylor, and his presence was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">extremely healing</a> for her. <a href=#>According to Glamour</a>, Mandy describes Taylor's influence as being "Steadfast in his support" of her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=scrabble-dates-provided-flirty-fun><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Scrabble Dates Provided Flirty Fun</span></h2><h2><span class=item-num>13 </span><span></span></h2><p>We know Mandy and Taylor met on social media after Mandy posted about her appreciation for his band Dawes, and Taylor slid into her DMs; Taylor worked his charms on Mandy and the pair progressed from a 'textationship' to hanging out in person.</p><p>When Mandy felt comfortable enough to share the news of her new relationship with the world, the first glimpse of her new man came courtesy of Instagram, where she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shared a snap</a> of her and her new beau playing Scrabble together!</p><h2 id=this-is-an-engagement><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>This Is An Engagement</span></h2><h2><span class=item-num>11 </span><span></span></h2><p>It didn't take long for Taylor to progress from a man Mandy was chatting with behind a screen to the man who would end up putting a ring on it.</p><p>The pair were dating for two years before<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> he popped the question</a>.&nbsp;Not only did Mandy share her great news with family, friends, and fans, there was an important group of people in her life she couldn't wait to share her joy with.
