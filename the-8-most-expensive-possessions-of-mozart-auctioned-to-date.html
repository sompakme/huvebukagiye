There’s hardly a single soul who has not heard of the legendary Mozart. Although his talented life was short-lived, the impact of his work is still affecting young souls to this day. His short yet rapid pace of blissful composition resulted in more than 800 different works of almost every genre of the 1700s.</p><p>Mozart was one of the most influential composers and was responsible for famous and loved pieces such as chamber, operatic, symphonic, and choral music. Legends like Mozart are only born once in a blue moon, and Mozart came to life in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Salzburg, home to a musical family</a>.</p><p>From a young age, Mozart’s family could tell that he was a musical prodigy. When he turned 5, he could read and even write music and would often entertain guests by playing on the keyboard for them. At age 6, he started writing his first-ever compositions. All this success was well-deserved because everyone thought of Mozart as a rate musical genius.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mozart’s parents recognized his talents early on and encouraged him to pursue his interests in music. After receiving intense musical training, Mozart was an efficient keyboard performer. His father took him on tour across Europe, where they stayed in England, Paris, and many other places where Mozart performed in front of the royal families.</p><h2 id=becoming-a-legend>Becoming A Legend</h2><p>Soon after the world became aware of his talents, Mozart was <a href=#>the most celebrated child prodigy</a> of his time. All the famous composers were impressed by his talent, and from a young age, he was exposed to different styles of music. From the age of ten to seventeen, Mozart tried his best to rise to the occasion. His father wanted him to try his luck as an opera composer. Thus, later in Italy, Mozart was commissioned for an opera.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Soon after, Mozart’s success grew rapidly beyond the various realms of musical contemporaries. But from age twenty-five to his unfortunate death at thirty-five, Mozart had the greatest developments in the entire history of music.</p><p>To this day, Mozart’s fans don’t get tired of speaking fondly of the great composer. His talents knew no bounds, and after his death, Mozart’s items or any kind of properties were kept well-preserved. Some were donated to charities, and some were put on display in museums over the world.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Celine Dion's 10 Most Expensive Possessions</a></span></p><p>However, there have been many auctions of Mozart’s possessions and you would be surprised to know how much those things are worth.</p><p>However, there have been many auctions of Mozart’s possessions, and you would be surprised to know how much those things are worth.</p><h2 id=an-original-handwritten-score-by-mozart>An Original Handwritten Score By Mozart</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A completely original handwritten score written by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was sold for 318,400 pounds at an auction in Paris. The score was from back in 1792 when Mozart was only 16.

The German written note is believed to be from either July or August of 1786. The letter was signed by Mozart and addressed to an Austrian Botanist to return the composers’ musical scores using a messenger.</p><h2 id=mozart-s-childhood-portrait>Mozart’s Childhood Portrait</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Mozart was 13, he was already quite famous among all the musical legends. When Mozart was on his Europe tour with his father, one of the listeners was so impressed by his sheer talent of Mozart that he commissioned a portrait for him. So, now there is a childhood portrait of the legendary Mozart, and it’s said to be valued at almost $883,233 to over $1,324,850.</p><h2 id=a-locket-of-mozart-s-hair>A Locket Of Mozart’s Hair</h2><p>We have heard about famous possessions such as a piece of clothing, portraits, or instruments, but now there’s a locket of Mozart’s hair being auctioned off.

The organization recently came into the possession of a musical score that was originally handwritten by Mozart. As we know, Mozart is considered one of the most prolific composers of all time so an original copy holds a lot of importance. It had previously been donated by a generous private connoisseur.
