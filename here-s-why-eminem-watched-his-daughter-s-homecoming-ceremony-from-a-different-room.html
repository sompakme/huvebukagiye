Students and faculty chose the beauty, who was described by those who know her as a “smart, athletic and caring young woman,” as the queen after a vote.</p><p>With her success at a young age as being chosen the queen at her school, her parents were surely proud of her. A parent who was not named revealed to the news outlet, “Hailie came out with her mother Kim when she was introduced with all other kids but her father watched from inside the school because he didn’t want to cause a scene – he wanted to have her own moment.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Stunning Photos Of Eminem's Daughter, Hailie Jade</a></span></p><p>Another parent said the American rapper was beaming when his daughter’s name was called. “He opened the door and looked out like – ‘That’s my daughter!’ He just looked like a proud father,” the parent recounted. Eminem, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who admits that his daughter Hailie serves as his primary source of motivation</a>, did not take the spotlight from her and instead, watched the proceedings privately in a different room.</p><p>Not only is the hip-hop icon a proud father during the homecoming ceremony, but he also very personal when it comes to his songs. He often includes references about his mother, ex-wife, and most famously, his daughter Hailie. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He mentions his daughter more than 23 times</a>&nbsp;in the songs including, Beautiful, My Darling, and Hailie’s Song.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eminem’s Daughter Hailie Jade Spreads Positivity And Mug Envy On Instagram</a></span></p><h2 id=where-is-hailie-now-and-what-does-she-do>Where Is Hailie Now And What Does She Do?</h2><p>The 25-year-old beauty has accomplished a lot in her life so far.
