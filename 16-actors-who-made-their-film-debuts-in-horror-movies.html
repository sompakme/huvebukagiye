Horror movies are a beloved genre that always leaves fans startled and satisfied. The horror genre also happens to be a genre in which many would-be Hollywood superstars have made their film debuts. They may not all have strong Rotten Tomatoes and Audience scores, but these actors have become household names since starring in these films.</p><p>Throughout the years, some of the biggest actors have “cut their teeth” in films where they avoid being… cut by teeth. With that thought in mind, let's take a look at a few of those stars who owe their stardom to the genre that has been with cinema from the beginning: the horror genre.
