Her incredible strength and lengthy feud with Becky Lynch showcased her growth as a wrestler and sports entertainer. From losing in 26 seconds at <a href=#>SummerSlam 2021</a> to stealing the show at WrestleMania 38, Bianca has become one of WWE's most reliable performers, deserving of high recognition.

Rockin' Robin's 502-day reign is the second-longest. However, if Bianca can hold on to her title through September of 2023, she will break that record. The competition in WWE's women's division is fierce, but a win at WrestleMania could help Bianca become an all-time great both in the ring and on the stat sheet.
