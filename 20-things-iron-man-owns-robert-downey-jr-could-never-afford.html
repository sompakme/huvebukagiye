Billionaire. Genius. Iron Man. It’s both his brains and his money that make him Iron Man, and that led to his developing the iconic Iron Man suit and its many iterations. The MCU movies show us many scenes of Tony using his very own weaponized tech to save the world, and sometimes screw it up too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But what about his everyday life? There must be days when he and Pepper just chill and hang out at home, right? What is Tony’s Stark’s lifestyle outside the Avengers and his world-saving duties? And how different is that lifestyle from the average dude’s? Plenty different, as you’d imagine. Naturally, some of the time, his private lifestyle and superhero gig cross paths, and some of his possessions end up serving double duty.</p><p>From the MCU and the comic book world, we’ve searched out the details. Here’s our list of some of the many things that Tony’s fortune – and smarts – have given him for work or for play that the rest of us, especially Robert Downey Jr., can only drool over.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-s-got-a-modern-art-collection-as-big-as-a-museum><strong>He’s Got A Modern Art Collection As Big As A Museum&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>At one time, as far as we know, Tony Stark had a pretty fab collection of modern art. That is, up till that moment in Iron Man 2. <i>Pepper: Did you just donate... Tony: Keep your business....Pepper: our entire modern art collection to the... Tony: Boy Scouts of America....Pepper: Boy Scouts of America? </i>The lines come from a scene where Tony is gradually realizing that he’s being poisoned by his Palladium arc reactor, and he’s feeling a little gloomy, to say the least. But, Pepper's right to be mad. She's spent ten years curating the collection of fine abstract expressionist paintings and sculptures at Tony's behest. Now, he's tossed it all out the window, figuratively speaking. We couldn’t help but notice that his walls always do seem to be well adorned with art of various kinds, so we’re assuming she’s been busy assembling a new collection ever since.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tony-s-amazing-armor-is-good-for-more-than-just-battle><strong>Tony’s Amazing Armor Is Good For More Than Just Battle</strong></h2><p>Tony’s iconic Iron Man armor has gone through several versions, and of course it owes its existence to his vast fortune. But, did you know that it has some other, non-superhero related uses? In Iron Man 3, Pepper Potts comes home to find that Tony has bought her a giant stuffed rabbit. He also has his remote-control unit, the Mark XLII, sitting on the sofa to impersonate him. The ruse doesn’t work for long, but he perfects the use of the unmanned Iron Man suit over time. By Spider Man: Homecoming, the Mark XLVII suit allowed Tony to intervene remotely in Spidey’s first battle with the Vulture, even though he was half a world away. Seems like there would be many uses for an unmanned Iron Man suit.</p><h2 id=tony-s-ai-enhanced-malibu-mansion-does-it-all><strong>Tony’s AI Enhanced Malibu Mansion Does It All</strong></h2><p>It really hurt when, in Iron Man 3, Tony’s iconic Malibu Mansion got completely destroyed by the Mandarin and his missile. Perched on a solitary cliff overlooking the ocean at the edge of Point Dume, a coastal park in Malibu, California, it looked the epitome of a post-modern debauched rich playboy’s mansion. The house is supposedly a “lost” design of real world architect John Lautner, a celebrated modernist, but art history cred is just the beginning. Thanks to J.A.R.V.I.S., the first AI system Tony developed, the house was fully automated and secure (just not against missiles!) In the comic Iron Man 2: Security Breach, an intruder named Lina manages to bypass the mansion's security codes, but is foiled at the very last one that guards his basement – and the Iron Man armor. J.A.R.V.I.S. announces that unless the correct code is entered in 30 seconds, the house will go into lockdown.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tony-s-yacht-can-think-for-itself><strong>Tony’s Yacht Can Think For Itself</strong></h2><p>With a mansion that can operate by itself, it comes as no surprise to learn that Tony’s yacht is also AI’d to the hilt. In the movies, we don’t know much about Tony and his yacht. It’s mentioned in the very first Iron Man movie, right at the very end. Just as he’s preparing for that press conference in the final scene, Coulson tells Tony his cover story will be that he was on his yacht, far away, with many witnesses who saw him partying, and that the Iron Man suit was a bodyguard that got blown up. In the comic Iron Man: The Gauntlet,&nbsp;we get a little more information about the yacht. Tony's on a mission in Ireland, and his yacht comes to save him on automatic pilot. The yacht's mechanisms use a robotic scoop to snag Tony and take him to safety on Dublin Bay. Tony's got another yacht called the Throatwarbler Mangrove that he keeps for sword fishing in the Caribbean, and assorted Avengers duty as needed. The boat's name, by the way, is a reference to a character from Monty Python's Flying Circus.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-many-planes-does-one-man-need><strong>How Many Planes Does One Man Need?</strong></h2><p>Now, your average billionaire is likely to have a private jet. Maybe two. But Tony Stark, we’re not even sure how many planes this man is supposed to have. In the first Iron Man movie, there’s that scene with Tony Stark and Lt. Colonel James "Rhodey" Rhodes in Tony’s private jet. You remember – the one where the air hostesses start dancing around the pole — that jet is a CGI modified Boeing 737 (Boeing 737-4B7) with the fuselage at the back altered. During Tony’s promo bio video, we see him in front of Lockheed Martin F-16 Fighting Falcons. Then, in Iron Man 2, when Tony is planning his grand entrance into his newly revived Stark Expo, he jumps out of what looks to be a C-130, which is a transport aircraft. He’s also got a helicopter — or two.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=file-tony-s-keyboard-under-ultra-cool-gadgets><strong>File Tony’s Keyboard Under Ultra-Cool Gadgets</strong></h2><p>Many of us like to brag about our tech, our new laptops, smart phones, and other electronic gadgets. But, we’ll never have a keyboard as cool as the one we see Tony using in the first Iron Man movie. It’s a glass holographic keyboard that he has customized with pictograms. The keyboard includes a series of symbols used in electrical engineering, including the voltmeter symbol, resistor and diode symbols, along with circuit design options. Another section on the right includes the numbers one to 10 in Mayan script. The keyboard lights up when he passes his hand over it, and monitors ambient light for the perfect illumination.</p><h2 id=tony-has-his-own-dancers><strong>Tony Has His Own Dancers</strong></h2><p>Sure, Elon Musk is cool, but, does he have his own dance troupe? In Iron Man 2, Tony revives Stark Expo, an expo and conference his father used to hold. The event is held in Flushing Meadows, New York City, and Tony reopens the gathering with a performance by The Ironettes, his very own dance company. Just after Tony makes his grand entrance&nbsp;— having dropped out of a plane in his Iron Man suit&nbsp;— the dancers take over the stage with a backdrop of the American flag. Once Tony removes his armor, they leave the stage, never to be seen again — at least not on camera. The scene involved 17 different dancers, each in their own bikini-like version of the Iron Man suit. Think we’ll see the Muskettes anytime soon?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tony-s-vintage-formula-racer-got-sliced><strong>Tony’s Vintage Formula Racer Got Sliced</strong></h2><p>"What's the point of owning a race car if you can't drive it?" So asks Tony in Iron Man 2, and he then proceeds to race a car in the Grand Prix de Monaco Historique, a vintage race held in Monte Carlo, to make his point. We definitely agree. Apparently, the race car Tony owned was either a genuine vintage car, or one styled like a 1970s-era Formula racers. As we all know, however, the car didn't last too long. Whiplash entered the race to wreak mayhem, and the poor car was destroyed, sliced by his laser whip. Trivia: the car was built specially for the movie, and was driven by stunt driver, and host of the show Top Gear USA, Tanner Foust. The design was based on molds of 1970s Wolf F1 cars; more specifically, it's said to be modeled after the WR6 from the 1978 season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tony-s-fleet-of-14-vintage-and-high-performance-supercars><strong>Tony’s Fleet Of 14 Vintage And High Performance Supercars</strong></h2><p>We’ve seen a few of Tony’s various vehicles throughout the Iron Man and Avengers movies. We’ve seen him in a 1932 Ford Flathead Roadster. At the end of the first Avengers movie, he drives away in his Acura 2012 Stark Industries Super Car with Bruce Banner in the passenger seat. Along with those, we’ve seen him driving in a variety of vehicles, some of which don’t survive the scene. They include an Audi R8 (2008), Saleen S7, Tesla Roadster, a classic 1967 Shelby Cobra, an Audi R8 V10 Spyder, a Rolls Royce Phantom, a 1953 Ghia Cadillac, a 1949 Mercury Coupe, a 1978 Wolf WR Ford Replica, an Acura NSX, a white Audi R8 e-tron, a red Audi R8 e-tron, and a Bugatti Veyron SS.</p><h2 id=tony-bought-a-bar-just-to-close-it><strong>Tony Bought A Bar Just To Close It</strong></h2><p>Ever had bad service, or some other type of bad experience, in a bar or restaurant, and wished you could do something about it? Like, get somebody fired? Tony Stark went one step further after his first encounter with General Thaddeus Ross. At the end of 2008's The Incredible Hulk, Ross, played by William Hurt, is sitting morosely at a bar when in walks Tony Stark. In the movie you saw at the theaters, the scene was brief, and ends where Tony tells Ross about a team that's being assembled. "Who's we?" asks Ross drunkenly. The scene is fleshed out on The Consultant, the first of the Marvel extra scenes. It was released on the Thor blu-ray disc in September 2011, situating the events of Thor before the story in The Incredible Hulk. In the fleshed-out scene, Ross is so annoyed at Tony that he tries to have him removed from the bar. Tony, however, simply buys up the bar, and then later arranges to have it demolished.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=has-his-life-model-decoy-do-the-job-instead><strong>Has His Life-Model Decoy Do The Job Instead</strong></h2><p>“You have reached the Life-Model Decoy of Tony Stark; please leave a message.” That’s what Tony Stark says to Phil Coulson when he’s trying to avoid taking his call in the first Avengers movie. In the MCU, Life Model Decoys, or L.M.D., were developed by S.H.I.E.L.D. but then abandoned because the android doubles, meant to protect key members of the organization, were never quite lifelike enough. As a concept, it's been revived on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. but it seems like Tony's wealth means that he's also got a version of his own. In the comics, Tony is hoping to evade the Mandarin, and uses an L.M.D. as his cover. But, to his horror, the L.M.D. began to think for itself and took over as Tony Stark, including running Stark Industries.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-s-got-a-million-dollar-cellar><strong>He’s Got A Million Dollar Cellar</strong></h2><p>We witness Tony Stark's love of champagne – Dom Perignon, no doubt flown in directly from France – in the first Iron Man movie, and on other occasions. In Iron Man 3, we get a look at his wine collection. As Tony’s juggling his relationship to Pepper Potts, and old friends like Happy Hogan, with his new responsibilities on the Avengers team, there is a scene where Tony’s talking to Hogan on the phone while he’s in his wine cellar. Interestingly, Tony's collection seems to include primarily modern Californian wines. He can be seen enjoying a glass of Hundred Acre Ark Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon as he talks on the phone. Hundred Acre Ark Vineyard Cab is extremely expensive, and you can't buy it in a store. You have to register on the company's waiting list&nbsp;— and there's no guarantee of ever being able to get your hands on a bottle, no matter how much cash you pony up. Other wines that can be seen are Jordan and Shafer Cabernet Sauvignons, and when he chooses a bottle for dinner with Pepper, it's a white wine from Mâcon, Burgundy</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=playtime-for-billionaires><strong>Playtime For Billionaires</strong></h2><p>Tony’s Malibu Mansion had an artificial waterfall in it, just for decoration. But, what does a billionaire do at home for fun? He’s got a grand piano and electric guitars. There’s a heliport and direct access to a private beach. The big picture windows on the mansion can also act as TV screens or monitors. When he's feeling more active, he’s got a private gym, with his own private&nbsp;— and huge&nbsp;— wrestling ring. That’s where he practices wrestling with Happy Hogan&nbsp;— and that’s a scene we’d like to see in an upcoming Avengers movie. Is Tony a WWE fan? We’ve not heard it so far, but maybe he is. The point is, when you’re Tony Stark, you can have everything you’d possibly want right at home.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-s-got-robot-assistants><strong>He’s Got Robot Assistants</strong></h2><p>Lots of people like to tinker with various projects in their garage or basement. If you’re rich, you may hire an assistant or student to help you out. If you’re Tony Stark, you create your own robots to not just help, but do the precision work for you. And, being Tony Stark, you give them silly names like Dum-E and U. Tony created Dum-E back in 1986 in his dad’s workshop, and U followed in 2009. They’ve appeared in every Iron Man movie as well as in Spider-Man: Homecoming, and they’ve become minor characters in their own right. They’ve saved Tony’s life by helping him make his suit, and in Iron Man, it was Dum-E who handed him his old arc reactor when Obidiah Stane steals the new one. U has been known to serve cocktails now and then. Despite all that, Tony still seems to get mad at them all the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-room-for-all-your-friends><strong>A Room For All Your Friends</strong></h2><p>It’s great having house parties, especially when you’re rich enough to afford to offer your guests the very best. Naturally, if you’ve already got a mansion, you’ve got guest rooms for people to stay over. Tony Stark’s guest rooms are for business and pleasure. After the Battle of New York in the first Avengers movie, Stark Tower, and Tony’s penthouse, are left damaged. As he and Pepper rebuild, they build on extra rooms for the rest of the Avengers team. Now, that’s taking your work home with you. We’d like to see the details. Is there a special area for the fab uniforms and outfits they all wear? Do they hang out in their dressing gowns and drink coffee in the morning?</p><h2 id=tony-s-got-a-wardrobe-rdj-definitely-can-t-afford><strong>Tony’s Got A Wardrobe&nbsp;RDJ Definitely&nbsp;Can't Afford</strong></h2><p>Robert Downey, Jr. and Tony Stark have become inseparable in terms of public image. It wasn’t long after the premiere of the original Iron Man movie that the media began calling RDJ a style icon, and it’s rumored that he uses his own wardrobe&nbsp;— largely suits, from what we can tell&nbsp;— in the MCU movies. Sometimes it’s hard to tell exactly what he’s wearing, but he does name drop a “lovely Tom Ford three-piece two button” in Captain America: Civil War. That will run you $4,000 to $7,000&nbsp;— and that’s if you order off the website. We feel like Tony would have his made to measure. In the first Iron Man movie, he appears to be wearing an Armani suit, worth about $5,000, as well as a Zegna brand leather jacket at about $7,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=even-his-casual-tech-is-off-the-charts><strong>Even His Casual Tech Is Off The Charts</strong></h2><p>We ordinary mortals might have the latest iPhone or a cool new tablet. Tony Stark? He's got a transparent PDA. Manufactured by a company called Deshawn Industries. It appears in Iron Man 2, and it's miles beyond a mere cell phone. He can use it to control his TV, and lock up the mansion when he's not there. During the court room scene, he also uses it to project data onto a monitor. In the first Iron Man move, Tony used a real life LG swivel-screen VX9400. It was a top of the line phone of the day back in 2008, and it seemed appropriate. For the sequel, though, Tony upped his game to the super charged see-through version.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tony-s-got-drool-worthy-cell-phones><strong>Tony’s Got Drool-Worthy Cell Phones</strong></h2><p>Natch, a king of the tech world needs the best of phones. In Captain America: Civil War, Tony’s handheld device projects pics and video as 3D holograms. Take that, Apple and Samsung! Holograms project the images onto thin air, and Tony can manipulate the images to expand and contract. He can change the orientation from portrait to landscape. Now, we see Tony using holographic technology a lot, from Iron Man 2 on, where he uses it in his basement lab. But, to bring it down to the level of a cell phone that allows you to point and click and holographically project your images anywhere you are? That’s next level.</p><h2 id=tony-s-got-massive-manhattan-real-estate><strong>Tony’s Got Massive Manhattan Real Estate</strong></h2><p>And you thought that East Side penthouse that served as Norman Osborn a.k.a. Green Goblin’s crib in the early Spider-Man movies was awesome (and it was). In the comics, Tony ends up owning what sounds like half of Manhattan at one time or another. At one point, he owned no less than five homes in New York City. One of his apartments was actually a whole floor in the Trump Tower. As a child, Tony lived in the Stark Mansion, which is on upscale Fifth Avenue and East 86th Street. He later gives that address to the Avengers to use. His other NYC homes are on the East Side, in Long Island at Stark International, and another at the Hawthorne Building in the Upper East Side.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-s-got-more-homes-than-you-can-count><strong>He’s Got More Homes Than You Can Count</strong></h2><p>Just how many homes does Tony have? We’re guessing that when you’re super rich, you probably lose track after a while. Along with his Malibu Mansion and the penthouse at Stark Enterprises, from the comics, we can learn that he’s got vacations covered too. He owns a cabin in the Adirondack Mountains that he keeps secret. There’s a Caribbean Island&nbsp;— yes, the whole thing&nbsp;— called Villa Mi Casa. He’s got a more conventional vacation home near Oneida, in upstate New York. That estate was built to survive a nuclear attack. In the late 1990s, he was often spotted at his Smart House on Evergreen Island in Seattle, WA. He’s also built a bunker in the Arctic. Recently, it was revealed that he also has a penthouse apartment in Osaka, Japan. Everywhere is home, we guess.</p><p>References:&nbsp;<a href=#>comicbook.com,</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>books.disney.com,</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>impdb.org,</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>scifi.stackexchange.com</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nYmV6tbTIp56sZZmnvK95zJqlZqeno8Buvs6bnKusXZm8uLrEsmSjql2YvLa4w2alnq6Vp3qissWoqZ1n</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f20-things-iron-man-owns-robert-downey-jr-could-never-afford.html&text=20%20Things%20Iron%20Man%20Owns%20Robert%20Downey%20Jr.%20Could%20Never%20Afford&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f20-things-iron-man-owns-robert-downey-jr-could-never-afford.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f20-things-iron-man-owns-robert-downey-jr-could-never-afford.html&title=20%20Things%20Iron%20Man%20Owns%20Robert%20Downey%20Jr.%20Could%20Never%20Afford" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f20-things-iron-man-owns-robert-downey-jr-could-never-afford.html&title=20%20Things%20Iron%20Man%20Owns%20Robert%20Downey%20Jr.%20Could%20Never%20Afford" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f20-things-iron-man-owns-robert-downey-jr-could-never-afford.html&title=20%20Things%20Iron%20Man%20Owns%20Robert%20Downey%20Jr.%20Could%20Never%20Afford" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f20-things-iron-man-owns-robert-downey-jr-could-never-afford.html&description=20%20Things%20Iron%20Man%20Owns%20Robert%20Downey%20Jr.%20Could%20Never%20Afford" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./connor-sturgeon-girlfriend-reddit-speculations-about-his-love-life.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Connor Sturgeon Girlfriend: Reddit Speculations About His Love Life">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./tom-swift-everything-to-know-about-the-nancy-drew-spinoff.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'Tom Swift': Everything to Know About the 'Nancy Drew' Spinoff">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
