It has since grown to become an incredibly popular show in its own right, showcasing the mysterious lives of a polygamous family who are navigating through family life on a daily basis. Of course, hoards of eagle-eyed fans tune in to lap up each drama-filled episode, which often shows the most chaotic moments of the family's relationships. Understandably, polygamous relationships intrigue many viewers, as it is still a relatively new adoption within society.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some notable moments from the series include when Kody told Christine he wasn't attracted to her on their wedding day, when Christine Brown left the relationship altogether and Meri Brown catching a catfish. However, now many fans have been left wondering if Meri Brown ever wanted more children with Kody Brown, or if she sensed early on that it wouldn't last with her now-ex.</p><h2 id=meri-and-kody-39-s-relationship-was-on-the-rocks-for-a-while>Meri And Kody's Relationship Was On The Rocks For A While</h2><p>It is no secret to fans that Meri and Kody had a rollercoaster of a relationship, with tensions often brewing between the pair for various reasons. However, things weren't only tremulous with Kody, they were also plenty of feathers being ruffled with the other wives, resulting in many of them not even wanting to interact with the reality star.</p><p>In fact, things got so bad between <a href=#>Kody, his wives that Kody and the other women went so far as to isolate Meri</a> from the rest of the group. This, among many other tensions over the course of the relationship ultimately piled pressure onto the family's polygamous relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On another previous occasion, tensions bubbled to the surface when Meri landed herself in a relationship with an online catfish. Naturally, this caused their relationship to go from bad to worse, with her and Kody struggling to work things out.</p><p>This was also another contributing factor as to why many of the wives did not want to speak to Meri during this time period. However, Meri isn't the only family member who has had a whirlwind of a relationship with Kody.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Sister Wives' Robyn Brown Is Taking The Blame For Kody's Poor Relationships With His Kids">Sister Wives' Robyn Brown Is Taking The Blame For Kody's Poor Relationships With His Kids</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many fans of the show will probably already know that Kody Brown and his now ex-wife Christine split up, marking yet another failed relationship for the father of seventeen. But <a href=#>why did Kody Brown and Christine split up</a>?</p><p>Kody felt as though he was no longer attracted to Christine, which was likely one of the contributing factors to their split. Information gathered from other reports also seems to indicate that the two likely had a personality clash, another factor leading to their split.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, many of <a href=#>Kody's children do not seem to be interested in pursuing polygamous relationships</a> in the future. For many fans, this comes as no surprise.</p><h2 id=kody-brown-was-adamant-that-he-wants-more-children-while-meri-was-unsure>Kody Brown Was Adamant That He Wants More Children While Meri Was Unsure</h2><p>Perhaps another contributing factor to their split, it seems as though <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Meri and Kody could not come to an agreement in terms of children</a>. During an episode of the show, Meri is seen breaking down in tears over their indifferent family goals.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the end of the discussion, Kody appears to be frustrated, and lashes out, telling Meri that he is 'going to have more kids with or without her'. Of course, this is visibly upsetting for Meri, likely due to her years of infertility.</p><p>The segment also shows Kody telling Meri that she only has five months to decide whether she 'wants to procreate again', telling her that 'they can't just keep going in circles.'</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/instar46062301.jpg><p>Currently, Kody and Meri have one adult child together, Leon Brown. Throughout her time on the show, it has become obvious to fans how fond Meri is of her child, with her focus being on him.</p><p>With her focus being on her child, some fans have speculated that it seems unlikely that Meri would share the same views as Kody on the matter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Does Sister Wives' Kody Brown Financially Support His Three Remaining Wives?">Does Sister Wives' Kody Brown Financially Support His Three Remaining Wives?</a></span></p><p>Besides Leon, Kody also has sixteen other children, who belong to him and his other ex-wives and wives. Despite this, Kody seems firmly set on having more. However, despite many being surprised, there are also many fans who were expecting Kody to continue to have children, especially with his youngest (and newest, albeit now the last remaining) wife Robyn.</p><h2 id=meri-and-kody-brown-have-now-split-up-after-a-tumultuous-relationship>Meri And Kody Brown Have Now Split Up After A Tumultuous Relationship</h2><p>After over thirty years of marriage, it seems that Meri and Kody's issues have taken a blow to their once-solid relationship. In December 2022, Meri and Kody confirmed their split from one another, something which came as a shock to many fans.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Sister Wives: Why Did Kody And Janelle Brown Separate?">Sister Wives: Why Did Kody And Janelle Brown Separate?</a></span></p><p>Their split comes around one year after Kody's split with Christine, which too, shocked many fans.
