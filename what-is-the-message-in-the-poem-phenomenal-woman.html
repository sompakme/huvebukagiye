The poem was <b>originally written to admire the beauty and self-confidence of a woman</b>.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-kind-of-poem-is-phenomenal-woman></span>What kind of poem is phenomenal woman?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>In her poem „Phenomenal woman” Angelou speaks as a self-confident woman, she wants to show the world what makes her beautiful and she expresses it in a various way. Let’s start with the form of the poem. The poem is like a ballad, it is <b>a free verse narrative</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-message-of-the-poem-alone-by-maya-angelou></span>What is the message of the poem alone by Maya Angelou?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Maya Angelou’s “Alone” is a poem that <b>deals with togetherness by placing emphasis on being alone; quite an irony</b>. It is a lyrical “thinking out loud”, a reflection on what it is to be a human and ‘out here’ in the big wide world.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-symbolism-in-phenomenal-woman></span>What is the symbolism in Phenomenal Woman?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The whole body and mind of a woman becomes an extended symbol in the poem. <b>Her arms are a symbol for her path to her dreams</b>. Her lips become symbol of the words and expression. Dancing feet become symbol of joy.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-does-the-poet-prove-that-she-is-a-phenomenal-woman></span>How does the poet prove that she is a Phenomenal Woman?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>According to the poet, it is <b>the fire i.e. passion in her eyes, her beautiful smiling teeth (flash of my teeth), her swinging (moving to and fro) waist and the joy in her feet</b> (probably the way she dances) that make her attractive and thus a phenomenally, phenomenal woman.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-message-might-this-poem-be-emphasizing-through-its-repetition-of-the-lines-alone-all-alone-nobody-but-nobody-can-make-it-out-here-alone-lines-35-37></span>What message might this poem be emphasizing through its repetition of the lines alone all alone Nobody but nobody can make it out here alone lines 35 37 )?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>They are motivated to find an answer because they know, “That nobody, / But nobody, / Can make it out here alone” (8-10), humanity is best when people come together. The speaker emphasizes these lines repeatedly across the poem reinforcing the <b>message that companionship is essential to thrive in this barren world</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-water-is-not-thirsty-meaning></span>Where water is not thirsty meaning?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>“Where water is not thirsty” (metaphor) – <b>The speaker once again lacks spiritual nourishment</b>. This line is another Biblical reference. Christ says that whoever drinks the water he provides well never thirst again. The speaker is so deprived of spiritual and religious connection that even water is thirsty.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-summary-of-alone-by-edgar-allan-poe></span>What is the summary of Alone by Edgar Allan Poe?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>In this autobiographical poem, a speaker describes his <b>lifelong feelings of loneliness, isolation, and difference</b>. His intense imaginative life, he writes, is a curse, forever setting him apart from other people. But it’s also a blessing, the source of his visionary power.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-theme-of-the-poem-alone-by-edgar-allan-poe></span>What is the theme of the poem alone by Edgar Allan Poe?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The main themes in the poem are <b>isolation and depression</b>. Poet Daniel Hoffman believed “Alone” was evidence that “Poe really was a haunted man.” The poem is dated March 17, 1829.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-does-maya-angelou-use-repetition-throughout-the-poem-alone></span>Why does Maya Angelou use repetition throughout the poem alone?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>By repeating those two words and that phrase multiple times, Angelou showed <b>the reader just how important it is to find somebody that cares about you</b> so you don’t have to be alone and unhappy. Angelou uses multiple different kinds of figurative language to enhance the message of the story.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-behind-the-storm-clouds-that-are-gathering-in-alone-by-maya-angelou></span>What is behind the storm clouds that are gathering in alone by Maya Angelou?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Up until this point, she seemed to be musing out loud. However, in this stanza she refers to the listener as “you,” revealing a desire to confide in another person. She explains that “storm clouds are gathering”—<b>a portent of suffering and doom</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-mystery-in-the-poem-alone-by-edgar-allan-poe></span>What is the mystery in the poem alone by Edgar Allan Poe?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>By Edgar Allan Poe<p>Remember, he’s writing this poem much later in life and is looking back on his childhood. Now, we know that the “mystery” took hold of the speaker during his childhood. The speaker drops a sweet metaphor to describe that childhood as the “<b>dawn/ of a most stormy life</b>.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-tone-of-the-poem-alone-by-edgar-allan-poe></span>What is the tone of the poem alone by Edgar Allan Poe?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The poem’s mood is dark and sinister. It is also sad because he is writing about how bad his life was compared to others. I also think that his own experiences relate to what he wrote. The tone of the poem is <b>Edgar Allan Poe feeling sorry for himself</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-did-edgar-allan-poe-write-the-poem-alone></span>Why did Edgar Allan Poe write the poem alone?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Edgar Allan Poe wrote “Alone” <b>to express certain themes</b>, including isolation, reflection, and the natural world.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-meaning-of-a-dream-within-a-dream></span>What is the meaning of a dream within a dream?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>‘A Dream Within a Dream’ explicitly describes <b>ideas that are recurring themes</b> in Poe’s other works, such as isolation, inner turmoil, the fine line between dreams and reality, and whether or not that line is comforting or worthy of despair.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=when-the-rest-of-heaven-was-blue-meaning></span>When the rest of Heaven was blue meaning?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The “rest of Heaven” is blue, <b>except for a cloud that looks like a demon</b>. That describes the speaker just perfectly. He’s the “demon,” while everybody else around him is the blue heaven.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-the-speaker-in-the-poem></span>Who is the speaker in the poem?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>In poetry, <b>the speaker is the voice behind the poem</b>—the person we imagine to be saying the thing out loud. It’s important to note that the speaker is not the poet. Even if the poem is biographical, you should treat the speaker as a fictional creation because the writer is choosing what to say about himself.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-did-poe-write-dream-within-a-dream></span>Why did Poe write dream within a dream?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Analyzing “A Dream Within a Dream”<p>Poe published the poem “A Dream Within a Dream” in 1849 in a magazine called Flag of Our Union. … “A Dream Within a Dream” was published near the end of Poe’s life, at <b>a time when his alcoholism was believed to be interfering with his day-to-day functioning</b>.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-is-symbolism-created-by-the-imagery-in-a-dream-within-a-dream></span>How is symbolism created by the imagery in a dream within a dream?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The poem is <b>allegorical in which life represents a dream</b>. The concrete symbols showcase life’s events falling into disappearance. Ex: The word “dream” the in poem symbolizes life; both are intangible. “Golden sand” symbolizes the speaker’s attempts to prove to himself that the earth is actually real.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-the-symbols-used-in-the-poem-a-dream-within-a-dream></span>What are the symbols used in the poem a dream within a dream?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The poem is allegorical in which life represents a dream. Within the poem though, there are symbols. <b>The sand represents lifes events falling into disappearance</b> and the past which is represented by the ocean.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=when-did-poe-write-a-dream-within-a-dream></span>When did Poe write a dream within a dream?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>1849 “A Dream Within a Dream” is a poem written by American poet Edgar Allan Poe, first published in <b>1849</b>. The poem has 24 lines, divided into two stanzas.<br>…<br>A Dream Within a Dream.<table><tbody><tr class=ztXv9><th colspan=2 style=text-align:center;padding-left:0>by Edgar Allan Poe</th></tr><tr><th colspan=2 style=text-align:center;padding-left:0>First published appearance in The Flag of Our Union</th></tr><tr><td style=padding-left:0>Read online</td><td>A Dream Within a Dream at Wikisource</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-does-pitiless-wave-mean></span>What does pitiless wave mean?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The “pitiless wave” harkens back to that roaring, tormenting surf, and makes us think of some type of unforgiving monster. Here, it seems to symbolize <b>the power of illusion or fantasy that keeps defeating the speaker’s attempts to convince himself that what is</b> in front of him is real and can be “grasped.”<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DAxJyfaKCfrHq1u46wn5qsXZ7AbsDHnmSmnaOorqixjKKlZqyYmnqxu8SmZKmglaO8rrHNmqNmr5%2Birq95kWg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-the-message-in-the-poem-phenomenal-woman.html&text=What%20is%20the%20message%20in%20the%20poem%20phenomenal%20woman&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-the-message-in-the-poem-phenomenal-woman.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-the-message-in-the-poem-phenomenal-woman.html&title=What%20is%20the%20message%20in%20the%20poem%20phenomenal%20woman" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-is-the-message-in-the-poem-phenomenal-woman.html&title=What%20is%20the%20message%20in%20the%20poem%20phenomenal%20woman" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-the-message-in-the-poem-phenomenal-woman.html&title=What%20is%20the%20message%20in%20the%20poem%20phenomenal%20woman" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-the-message-in-the-poem-phenomenal-woman.html&description=What%20is%20the%20message%20in%20the%20poem%20phenomenal%20woman" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-mary-fowler-dating-know-about-the-australian-soccer-player-s-partner.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Mary Fowler Dating?
