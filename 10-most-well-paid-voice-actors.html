Of course, it's not nearly as easy as it sounds - if it was, everybody would be doing it. So when a truly terrific voice actor comes around, they are paid enormous amounts of money for their talent.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Matthew McConaughey Voices New Sleep Story On Calm App</a></span></p><p>It's also hard to earn fame as a voice actor, so you have to be REALLY good at your job to earn such acclaim, recognition, and riches for your work. The fact that you probably know these names speaks a lot to their abilities as voice actors. These are ten of the most well-paid voice actors in the industry.</p><h2 id=troy-baker>Troy Baker</h2><p>Troy Baker is one of the most acclaimed and highly sought-after voice actors in the video game industry. In a medium typically known for its mediocre and relatively careless voice acting, Baker has turned the stigma on its head with mature and incredibly nuanced performances. He has starred in countless acclaimed video games over the years, including BioShock Infinite, The Last of Us, God of War, and Uncharted 4.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While his exact salary is hard to pin, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">estimates</a> place his net worth at $6 million. This is a relatively small amount when you compare it to the megastars of animation, but it's still an envious and respectable haul, especially when you consider his relatively recent rise to stardom.</p><h2 id=dan-castellaneta>Dan Castellaneta</h2><p>Dan Castellaneta is one of the most famous voice actors of all time. He's appeared in countless animated TV shows throughout the years, although he's primarily known as the voice of Homer Simpson. However, he also provides the voices of Abe, Krusty, Barney, and Groundskeeper Willie, among various smaller, bit characters throughout the series.</p><p>Dan <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">currently earns</a> $300,000&nbsp;PER EPISODE of The Simpsons, and according to Celebrity Net Worth, he's currently worth about $85 million. Considering&nbsp;The Simpsons&nbsp;may never end, Castellaneta should be set for a while longer.</p><h2 id=yeardley-smith>Yeardley Smith</h2><p>Get used to hearing about The Simpsons, because this cast truly earns the big bucks. Yeardley originally auditioned for the role of Bart, but the casting director said that her voice was too high. As a result, she was given the role of Lisa, a role she has beautifully inhabited ever since.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like her co-star Dan Castellaneta, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yeardley is paid $300,000 per episode</a> of The Simpsons, and also has a net worth in the $85 million range. The Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance probably helped with that.</p><h2 id=julie-kavner>Julie Kavner</h2><p>Julie Kavner was quite well known before her time on The Simpsons. She was nominated for four Emmy awards for her work as Brenda Morgenstern on the sitcom Rhoda&nbsp;and even won the award in 1978. She is now known for voicing Marge Simpson, as well as her sisters Patty and Selma.</p><p>Her work on The Simpsons has brought her further acclaim, as she has won both an Emmy and an Annie Award for her work on the show. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Like her co-stars</a>, Julie currently earns about $300,000 per episode and has a net worth estimated at $85 million.</p><h2 id=mike-judge>Mike Judge</h2><p>For the sake of variety, let's leave The Simpsons behind us - just know that all the main cast members earn roughly the same amount of money! Let's move on to Mike Judge, who is primarily known for voicing the controversial duo Beavis and Butt-head and Hank Hill.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While he has&nbsp;returned to those characters throughout the years, he has also worked on Aqua Teen Hunger Force, R.I.P.D., The Goode Family, and the recent Mike Judge Presents: Tales from the Tour Bus, among others. For all his hard work, he has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">amassed a fortune</a> of roughly $75 million. Which, to be honest, is surprisingly low, considering he has created and produced numerous shows!</p><h2 id=billy-west>Billy West</h2><p>Billy West may not be as well known as his contemporaries, but he's still an acclaimed and respected voice actor who has clout in the industry. He is perhaps most famous for his work on Futurama, where he voiced Fry, Farnsworth, Zoidberg, and Zapp Brannigan.</p><p>However, he has also worked on countless animations, including King of the Hill, The Ren & Stimpy Show, and Netflix's Disenchantment. He is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">currently worth</a> about $35 million.</p><h2 id=mark-hamill>Mark Hamill</h2><p>It looked like Mark Hamill was going to be a one-hit wonder. He was a household name in the late 70s and early 80s thanks to starring in the original Star Wars trilogy, but he sort of dropped off the map following its conclusion. Luckily, he found substantial work in 1992 with Batman: The Animated Series, for which he provided the voice of The Joker.&nbsp;His voice has since become synonymous with The Joker, and he has reprised his role through countless TV shows and video games, including Justice League, Justice League Action, and the Batman: Arkham series of games.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In fact, prior to The Last Jedi, Mark Hamill was arguably just as well known as the voice of The Joker as he was for Luke Skywalker. He is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">currently worth</a> an estimated $18 million, although there's no saying how much of that came from his work as The Joker.</p><h2 id=seth-macfarlane>Seth MacFarlane</h2><p>Seth MacFarlane is arguably the most popular voice actor in the business. He is most well-known for creating Family Guy and performing a host of vocal duties within the show, voicing characters like Peter, Stewie, Brian, and Quagmire. However, his work has expanded well beyond Family Guy, and he has also created and performs in both The Cleveland Show and American Dad!, and he also voiced the titular Ted in the Ted movies.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to the Gazette Review</a>, Seth earns around $50,000 per episode of Family Guy on top of his $2 million annual salaries, and he is currently worth between $200 and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$250 million</a>! There's big money in creating some of the most beloved animated sitcoms of all time. Who knew?</p><h2 id=matt-stone>Matt Stone</h2><p>Matt Stone is one of the biggest names in the industry, and easily one of the most acclaimed voice actors currently working today. Along with his working partner Trey Parker, Matt Stone created South Park, which began airing way back in 1997 (are you feeling old yet?).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Matt provides the voices of Kyle, Kenny, and Butters. In 2015, Matt and Trey <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">signed deals</a> with Hulu and Comedy Central worth $192 million, $110 million of which were split between Matt and Trey. Matt is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">currently worth</a> a whopping $500 million, making him not only one of the richest voice actors, but one of the richest men in Hollywood.</p><h2 id=trey-parker>Trey Parker</h2><p>If we're mentioning Matt Stone, we have to mention his creative partner Trey Parker as well. Parker co-created South Park with Stone, and he provides the voices of both Stan Marsh and Eric Cartman, which is easily the most recognizable and parodied voice in the show.</p><p>And, just like his creative partner, Trey Parker is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">currently worth </a>an estimated $500 million. As controversial as South Park is, there's no denying that it has been incredibly lucrative for the two men.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Mission: Impossible - Every Major Cast Member's Net Worth</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTDsLXCnmSam6Skv7R5wZ6qrWWglralew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f10-most-well-paid-voice-actors.html&text=10%20Most%20Well-Paid%20Voice%20Actors&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-most-well-paid-voice-actors.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-most-well-paid-voice-actors.html&title=10%20Most%20Well-Paid%20Voice%20Actors" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f10-most-well-paid-voice-actors.html&title=10%20Most%20Well-Paid%20Voice%20Actors" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f10-most-well-paid-voice-actors.html&title=10%20Most%20Well-Paid%20Voice%20Actors" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-most-well-paid-voice-actors.html&description=10%20Most%20Well-Paid%20Voice%20Actors" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./19-lord-of-the-rings-cast-members-who-are-still-trying-to-stay-relevant.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="19 Lord Of The Rings Cast Members Who Are Still Trying To Stay Relevant">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./kevin-daniels-actor-biography-age-height-the-orville-movies-and-tv-shows.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kevin Daniels (Actor) Biography, Age, Height, The Orville, Movies and TV Shows">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
