The daughter of the 7th Earl Spencer, she became friends with Prince Charles in 1980, and within a year, the pair were engaged. Diana’s beauty and kindness made her an instant media sensation and an icon for her grace and elegance. After eleven years of marriage, <a href=#>Prince Charles and Princess Diana</a> formally separated before finalizing their divorce in 1996.</p><p>Even after the divorce and losing the title of Her Royal Highness, Princess Diana remained popular and made appearances through her charity work. Due to her compassion and humility, she became known as the People’s Princess. The world was shaken on 31 August 1997 when the news of her death was announced, causing hysteria. Let’s look at some crazy facts about the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-was-on-a-vacation-in-europe><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>She Was On A Vacation In Europe</span></h2><p>In July 1997, Princess Diana was first linked to Egyptian film producer Dodi Fayed before they were spotted on vacation the following month. En route to London, the couple stopped in Paris and climbed aboard the Jonikal, Fayed’s private yacht. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She was in St. Tropez</a> before going to Paris with Prince William and Prince Harry.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Princess Diana's Relationship With Harry And William, Captured In Photos</a></span></p><h2 id=she-died-in-a-car-crash-in-paris><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>She Died In A Car Crash In Paris</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Princess Diana and Dodi Fayed were staying at the Ritz Hotel in Paris. After discovering more than 30 photographers waiting, they decided to go to Fayed’s apartment. The car was driven by an intoxicated driver Henri Paul, whose respective bodyguards accompanied the two. With a hoard of paparazzi chasing after them, <a href=#>the driver lost control at the entrance of the Pont de l’Alma tunnel and crashed into a pillar</a>.</p><h2 id=a-responder-heard-her-last-words><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>A Responder heard her Last Words</span></h2><p>Dodi Fayed and driver Henri Paul were announced dead soon after the firefighters arrived, while the Princess and Fayed’s bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones were conscious but injured. Jones was the only person wearing a seatbelt during the ride. Firefighter Xavier Gourmelon massaged Diana’s heart until she was breathing again. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Her final words were, ‘My God, what has happened?’</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>An Inside Look At Princess Diana's Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=her-injury-was-rare-and-small><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Her Injury Was Rare And Small</span></h2><p>After being admitted to the La Pitie Salpetriere Hospital, Princess Diana did not gain consciousness and died of internal bleeding. She was pronounced dead in the early hours of 31 August 1997. A study later revealed that the cause of her death was a tear in the vein of her lung. The injury was easily preventable if she wore a seatbelt.</p><h2 id=there-are-many-speculations-about-the-accident><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>There Are Many Speculations About The Accident</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There were many speculations regarding the accident. Dodi Fayed’s father, Mohammed al-Fayed, claimed it was a deliberate murder orchestrated by MI6 Agents. At the same time, a butler published a note reportedly written by Princess Diana that Prince Charles was planning a car accident. These theories were later debunked after police investigations in 2004.</p><h2 id=britain-was-deeply-shocked-by-her-sudden-loss><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Britain Was Deeply Shocked By Her Sudden Loss</span></h2><p>While the family was away at Balmoral, thousands of people left mementos, flowers, and photos outside Buckingham Palace to honor her life.

The Queen decided to keep Prince William and Prince Harry in Scotland for a few days. They were allowed to mourn and were shielded from the media to have their space.</p><h2 id=the-queen-addressed-the-nation-after-five-days-of-her-death><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>The Queen Addressed The Nation After Five Days Of Her Death</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>The Queen stayed back at Balmoral Castle with the Princes</a> and had planned to return to London before the funeral. The Royal family came under deep scrutiny when the Queen did not address the mourning nation immediately after the accident. Five days after the death, she made her first broadcast live since the Gulf War in 1991.</p><h2 id=her-funeral-had-billions-of-viewers><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Her Funeral Had Billions Of Viewers</span></h2><p>While 750 million people watched Princess Diana marry Prince Charles, her funeral had a record total of 2.5 billion viewers.

To commemorate the Princess, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a statue was unveiled by Prince William and Prince Harry</a> at Kensington Palace in the Sunken Garden. The statue was situated at her favorite spot and commissioned to honor the philanthropic work she had done for the people.</p><p>Princess Diana’s funeral was an emotional affair where Elton John changed a few lyrics and dedicated the song Candle In The Wind to the former monarch. No figure in this world has had a bigger impact than Diana, from her fashion to compassion, and her legacy lives on long after her untimely death.</p><p>Sources: People, Parade, Insider, Harper’s Bazaar</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhoaWWTp667xYyfmJyso2Kuo7vUrWStoJVisaat06FkqJ5dpb%2BqusKeqqxllJ6ur62O</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f10-facts-about-princess-diana-s-death-that-will-blow-your-mind.html&text=10%20Facts%20About%20Princess%20Diana%27s%20Death%20That%20Will%20Blow%20Your%20Mind&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-facts-about-princess-diana-s-death-that-will-blow-your-mind.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-facts-about-princess-diana-s-death-that-will-blow-your-mind.html&title=10%20Facts%20About%20Princess%20Diana%27s%20Death%20That%20Will%20Blow%20Your%20Mind" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f10-facts-about-princess-diana-s-death-that-will-blow-your-mind.html&title=10%20Facts%20About%20Princess%20Diana%27s%20Death%20That%20Will%20Blow%20Your%20Mind" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f10-facts-about-princess-diana-s-death-that-will-blow-your-mind.html&title=10%20Facts%20About%20Princess%20Diana%27s%20Death%20That%20Will%20Blow%20Your%20Mind" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-facts-about-princess-diana-s-death-that-will-blow-your-mind.html&description=10%20Facts%20About%20Princess%20Diana%27s%20Death%20That%20Will%20Blow%20Your%20Mind" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./amy-winehouse-s-dress-sells-for-67-000.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Amy Winehouse's Dress Sells for $67,000!">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./young-m-a-hints-at-new-music-celebrates-recent-weight-loss.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Young M.A. Hints At New Music, Celebrates Recent Weight Loss">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
