Bachelor nation: grab your roses and a bottle of wine because we are to dish on some bachelor couples who survived the show and others who hit the end of the road!</p><h2 id=didn-t-survive-courtney-robertson-amp-ben-flajnik>Didn't Survive: Courtney Robertson & Ben Flajnik</h2><p>Who doesn’t love a good throw-back? Ben was one of the most underrated bachelors to date. But he’s by far one of the coolest. He lives in Sonoma and is friends with Kris Jenner, how about that? Yes, he literally drinks wine on his vineyard with Queen KJ.</p><p>In 2012, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Courtney</a> stole Ben’s heart while simultaneously becoming one of the most disliked contestants in the franchise’s history. After they split she released a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">book</a> about everything called, “I Didn’t Come Here to Make Friends: Confessions of a Reality Show Villain.”</p><p>Let’s just say Ben was not happy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=survived-ashley-iaconetti-amp-jared-haibon>Survived: Ashley Iaconetti & Jared Haibon</h2><p>*Sips wine* OK, Chris Harrison, we can confirm that Ashley and Jared had the most dramatic relationship saga in the history of not only this show but any other reality TV show ever. We’re just going to come out and say it: Ashely I’s crying face is better than Kim Kardashian’s.</p><p>This relationship was way deeper than what we saw on Bachelor in Paradise. Many couples get together before or after the show(s) and do have a history we don’t know about. These two were one of those couples, which is why Ashley was unable to catch her breath if Jared blinked at her the wrong way. We are very happy to say that Ashley got her happily ever after <a href=#>marrying</a> Jared a few months ago.</p><h2 id=didn-t-survive-nick-viall-vs-the-entire-bachelor-franchise-cast>Didn't Survive: Nick Viall VS. The Entire Bachelor Franchise Cast</h2><p>No one on Earth has had more chances at love than Nick Viall. Viall started off on Andi Dorfman’s season of <i>The Bachelorette</i> as just a regular guy who fell in love. Ultimately, he got his heartbroken when he made it to runner-up. Then Nick shows up on Kaitlyn Bristowe’s season to again fall in love but end up being runner-up, <i>again.</i> In both cases, he won over viewers' hearts. At this point, the whole world rooting for him - <i>please baby Jesus find this man a wife!</i></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And so he goes onto <i>Bachelor in Paradise</i> and still has no luck. Our prayers were finally answered when he became “The Bachelor,” where he found himself in a sea of beautiful women who were there just for him. <i>So how does someone mess that up? </i>Shortly, after proposing to an angel special education teacher, Vanessa Grimaldi, the couple called it quits.</p><p>Hate to break it to you but maybe it's not them, Nick... <i>it's you.</i></p><h2 id=survived-cassie-randolph-amp-colton-underwood>Survived: Cassie Randolph & Colton Underwood</h2><p>Cassie and Colton have been through some serious ups and downs. Who could forget when he jumped the fence in a foreign country and literally ran away after an indecisive Cassie said she wasn’t ready to get engaged?&nbsp; That our friends, is some very good television!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The 10 Richest Countries In The World</a></span></p><p>Outside of the fence-jumping and tears and despite the world thinking that there was a zero percent chance of this relationship lasting, Cassie and Colton are actually still together. The couple looks happier than ever as they recently celebrated their anniversary with a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">trip</a> to St. Lucia.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=survived-carly-waddell-amp-evan-bass>Survived: Carly Waddell & Evan Bass</h2><p>There is really no gentle way to phrase this: Evan was portrayed on The Bachelorette as the most unlikely winner of the bunch. However, Bachelor in Paradise is known as the land of second chances and comebacks.</p><p>Evan came to paradise with his eyes on the prize. He wasted no time on making Carly his lady; he even faked an injury to get her to take care of him so he could spend more time with her! Although they shared the most jarring kiss in the franchise’s history, Carly and Evan are happily married. They had their first child together, Bella, and recently welcomed their son Charles.</p><p>Yes, they named their son Charles Bass; XOXO Gossip Girl.</p><h2 id=didn-t-survive-whitney-bischoff-amp-chris-soules>Didn't Survive: Whitney Bischoff & Chris Soules</h2><p>There are some seasons where you know, within two seconds of the first episode, who the winner is going to be. Whitney Bischoff was one of those women whose beauty shined from the inside out. You not only knew Chris Soules was going to end up choosing her but that she’d also be the best possible future wife and mother someone could ask for.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chris Soules, on the other hand, took a turn for the worse. Not only did he and Bischoff end their engagement, he found himself in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">jail</a> for the last two years for leaving the scene of a car crash that killed someone.</p><h2 id=survived-ashley-hebert-amp-j-p-rosenbaum>Survived: Ashley Hebert & J.P. Rosenbaum</h2><p>If you’re a true Bachelorette fan, you know us girls have the strongest intuition. From the moment J.P. stepped out of that limo, it was game-over for Ashley. You saw the way his smile instantly lit up her world. They were one of those couples that you thought would be a forever type of love. But where are they now?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Celebrities Who Married A Non-Famous Person</a></span></p><p>Ashley and J.P. are still very much in love, they recently renewed their vows. And their love grew two sizes; they welcomed son Fordham and daughter Essie. Not to mention, they are clones of Ashley and J.P.!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=didn-t-survive-kaitlyn-bristowe-amp-shawn-booth>Didn't Survive: Kaitlyn Bristowe & Shawn Booth</h2><p>Kaitlyn Bristowe had to endure the most horrifying ways to become the next bachelorette. It was the closest thing to the real-life Hunger Games; men literally voted whether they wanted her or Britt Nilsson to become the bachelorette.</p><p>The majority of men voted on Kaitlyn making her ABC’s “Bachelorette 11.” Shawn and Kaitlyn’s relationship was the perfect <a href=#>love</a> story. The night she was eliminated from The Bachelor, Shawn took a snapchat of her and drew a heart around it and wrote, “Don’t worry Kaitlyn, I’m coming for you.” Sadly, after a very long engagement, the couple has gone their separate ways.</p><h2 id=survived-becca-kufrin-amp-garrett-yrigoyen>Survived: Becca Kufrin & Garrett Yrigoyen</h2><p>Becca Kufrin had one of the most gut-wrenching experiences on The Bachelor. Arie Luyendyk ended up not only giving her his final rose but dropping down on one knee. What looked like the happiest day of Becca’s life quickly turned into her worst nightmare.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Celebrities Who Love Watching Reality TV</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Completely blindsided and not too long after their engagement with a full camera-crew, Arie says they need to talk. He tells her he made the wrong choice and is ending their engagement to go pursue runner-up Lauren Burnham. At that moment Becca was all of us who have ever gotten our heartbroken. No one was more deserving then Becca for the role of the bachelorette and it looks like she has found everlasting love with Garrett. The couple lives together and recently welcomed a Corgi puppy into their little family.</p><h2 id=didn-t-survive-lauren-bushnell-amp-ben-higgins>Didn't Survive: Lauren Bushnell & Ben Higgins</h2><p>So here’s the thing about Ben and Lauren: they are two great people. Throughout the season, you fell in love with both of them. After their televised engagement that could have made even the darkest of souls cry, they moved on to their new show, Ben and Lauren: Happily Ever After? Here you saw that although they were two perfect people who sadly weren’t perfect together, which led to their break-up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Alexa: play Beyoncé’s “Upgrade U.” Lauren needs to write a bachelor-bible: how to win it all. She is living her best life married to country singer, Chris Lane. He even wrote a chart-topping song, “Big, Big Plans,” which was about and starred Lauren.</p><p>*Holds up wine glass* Lauren, you get all of the roses, sis.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>10 Real Marriage Ceremonies Between People And Objects</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrZ2cmsOqv8iopWiakZi1prjOq2SfqpGjsKm10p5knKelpbmmv4ysrKuumauypXnBq6aknV2qvXA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f5-bachelor-franchise-couples-who-survived-the-show-5-who-didn-t.html&text=5%20Bachelor%20Franchise%20Couples%20Who%20Survived%20The%20Show%20%28%26amp%3b%205%20Who%20Didnt%29&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f5-bachelor-franchise-couples-who-survived-the-show-5-who-didn-t.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f5-bachelor-franchise-couples-who-survived-the-show-5-who-didn-t.html&title=5%20Bachelor%20Franchise%20Couples%20Who%20Survived%20The%20Show%20%28%26amp%3b%205%20Who%20Didnt%29" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f5-bachelor-franchise-couples-who-survived-the-show-5-who-didn-t.html&title=5%20Bachelor%20Franchise%20Couples%20Who%20Survived%20The%20Show%20%28%26amp%3b%205%20Who%20Didnt%29" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f5-bachelor-franchise-couples-who-survived-the-show-5-who-didn-t.html&title=5%20Bachelor%20Franchise%20Couples%20Who%20Survived%20The%20Show%20%28%26amp%3b%205%20Who%20Didnt%29" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f5-bachelor-franchise-couples-who-survived-the-show-5-who-didn-t.html&description=5%20Bachelor%20Franchise%20Couples%20Who%20Survived%20The%20Show%20%28%26amp%3b%205%20Who%20Didnt%29" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./andy-cohen-might-get-credit-for-real-housewives-success-but-it-wasn-t-his-idea.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Andy Cohen Might Get Credit For Real Housewives' Success, But It Wasn't His Idea">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-zia-quizon-boyfriend-alexsa-couple-getting-married-after-long-term-relationship.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Zia Quizon Boyfriend Alexsa?
