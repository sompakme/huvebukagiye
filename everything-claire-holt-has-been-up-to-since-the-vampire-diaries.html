Each project was unique, and each still maintains a sizable fandom after all these years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Claire Holt was a mainstay on The Vampire Diaries early on, and she helped the show become a huge hit. Since her time on the show, Holt has done some solid work.</p><p>Let's take a look and see what she has been up to.</p><h2 id=claire-holt-was-a-huge-part-of-39-the-vampire-diaries-39>Claire Holt Was A Huge Part Of 'The Vampire Diaries'</h2><p>Beginning back in 2011, Claire Holt played the character Rebekah Mikaelson on The Vampire Diaries, and she was a popular member of the show. H2O: Just Add Water was a huge break for Holt early on, but The Vampire Diaries took her popularity to another level.</p><p>For 37 episodes, Holt was a series mainstay early on, and she helped the series rocket off to success on the small screen. Because of this, it makes sense that she has become such a popular performer within the fandom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Vampire Diaries was great for her career, but Holt has made sure to do film and additional television work in the years since.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Nina Dobrev's Life And Net Worth Changed After 'The Vampire Diaries'</a></span></p><h2 id=she-starred-in-39-47-meters-down-39>She Starred In '47 Meters Down'</h2><p>Claire Holt's television work has certainly given her career a major boost, but this does not mean that she has avoided landing roles in the world of film. She did not have many film roles preceding her time on The Vampire Diaries, but in 2017, several years after the show ended, Holt snagged a role in the hit film, 47 Meters Down.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the movie, Holt starred alongside Mandy Moore, and the two were a solid duo on the big screen in this survival horror film. The movie had a tiny budget, but thanks to some solid trailers, it was able to generate over $60 million at the box office, making it a solid financial success that even spawned a sequel.</p><p>Since her time in 47 Meters Down, Holt has continued to do some film work, though she does not snag roles all the time. Her most recent film project was Untitled Horror Movie, which is a horror comedy that is pretty on-the-nose in regard to its subject matter and the current climate we live in.</p><p>When speaking about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">filming remotely</a> and her excitement for the project, Holt said, "Obviously, it would be a huge challenge because we had to shoot this ourselves, and Iâ€™m really crap with technology and mess everything up. I canâ€™t believe I even got into this Zoom today, to be honest."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I was so down to try it and see what we could do, and Iâ€™m thrilled with the outcome, and Iâ€™m so excited the world is going to get to it see it. Not just because Iâ€™m really proud of our work but because Iâ€™m excited the world is going to see what Luke and Nick [Simon] have been able to create together," she continued.</p><p>Holt's film work has been solid, but television has truly been her bread and butter.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Close Are 'The Vampire Diaries' Stars Ian Somerhalder And Paul Wesley Today?</a></span></p><h2 id=she-starred-on-39-the-originals-39>She Starred On 'The Originals'</h2><p>When taking a look at her small-screen work, it becomes quite clear that The Vampire Diaries played such an important part in Holt's career. Since the show ended, Claire Holt has just two major projects, and the bigger success of the two just so happens to be a Vampire Diaries spin-off show</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Debuting back in 2013, The Originals was a hugely successful spin-off show for the Vampire Diaries franchise. Featuring a number of popular Vampire Diaries actors, The Originals was just what fans of the first show were looking for. It's not often that a spin-off project will find so much success, but after 5 seasons and nearly 100 episodes, it's quite clear that The Originals was a hit.</p><p>For 2 seasons and 22 episodes, Holt would also star on Aquarius, which was a period crime drama. The series, which featured performers like David Duchovny and Emma Dumont, did not have a lengthy run on the small screen, but it was the other major project that Holt has worked on since her Vampire Diaries days.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Does Nina Dobrev Regret Quitting 'The Vampire Diaries' When She Did?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At this time, Holt does have one project in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">post-production</a>, that being Painted Beauty. Fans will certainly be keeping an eye on this movie, and they will also be patiently waiting to see if Holt pops up on another hit television show in the coming years.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Fans Label Nina Dobrev And Chace Crawfordâ€™s New Selfie As A â€˜Vampire Diaries And Gossip Girl Crossoverâ€™</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicr52irsGptc2gZJykkZ6%2FpnnHqKOtZZiWwG6uxJ6lZq2gYsGwedKipZydXam1pnnVmqSpoaKaeqW1wKugnqtdrLWmvsRmmKudXam1psWMp6awZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2feverything-claire-holt-has-been-up-to-since-the-vampire-diaries.html&text=Everything%20Claire%20Holt%20Has%20Been%20Up%20To%20Since%20%27The%20Vampire%20Diaries%27&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2feverything-claire-holt-has-been-up-to-since-the-vampire-diaries.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2feverything-claire-holt-has-been-up-to-since-the-vampire-diaries.html&title=Everything%20Claire%20Holt%20Has%20Been%20Up%20To%20Since%20%27The%20Vampire%20Diaries%27" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2feverything-claire-holt-has-been-up-to-since-the-vampire-diaries.html&title=Everything%20Claire%20Holt%20Has%20Been%20Up%20To%20Since%20%27The%20Vampire%20Diaries%27" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2feverything-claire-holt-has-been-up-to-since-the-vampire-diaries.html&title=Everything%20Claire%20Holt%20Has%20Been%20Up%20To%20Since%20%27The%20Vampire%20Diaries%27" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2feverything-claire-holt-has-been-up-to-since-the-vampire-diaries.html&description=Everything%20Claire%20Holt%20Has%20Been%20Up%20To%20Since%20%27The%20Vampire%20Diaries%27" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./humberto-cravioto-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Humberto Cravioto Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./emma-stone-strips-down-on-the-cover-of-w-magazine.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Emma Stone Strips Down On The Cover of W Magazine">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
