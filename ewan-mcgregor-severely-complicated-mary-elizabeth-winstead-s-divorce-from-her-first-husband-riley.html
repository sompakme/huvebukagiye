However, her appearances in the remakes of Black Christmas and The Thing, along with her turn in Final Destination 3, are what people most associate her with. Although <a href=#>Winstead said no to a popular teen movie</a>, her resume is pretty packed, and it's fun to see her play final girls and characters in terrifying situations.</p><p>Mary Elizabeth Winstead may be a beloved actress, but she isn't typically the subject of massive media coverage. That all changed in 2017 when she shared that she and Riley Stearns were getting divorced. Since Winstead began dating Ewan McGregor a little while after, fans were intrigued, and there's a lot to know about this whole situation...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-did-mary-elizabeth-winstead-and-riley-stearns-get-divorced>Why Did Mary Elizabeth Winstead And Riley Stearns Get Divorced?</h2><p><a href=#>Ewan McGregor has a better relationship with his daughters</a> now than he did when he and Mary Elizabeth Winstead first began dating.

McGregor was also going through a divorce. He and his first wife, Eve Mavrakis, were married from 2005 to 2018.</p><p>While the actors did meet while they were both still married, they didn't become romantically involved until they knew that their respective relationships were finished. There was definitely no overlap. It must have been an emotional time for both actors, though.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/mary-elizabeth-winstead-riley-stearns.jpg><p>Winstead and Stearns were married from 2010 to 2017.

However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Winstead talked about her divorce</a> in an interview with Glamour UK in 2020 and was honest.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/mary-elizabeth-winstead.jpg><p>The actress said, "I got divorced a couple of years ago, which was a scary, crazy thing for me because I had been with the same person since I was 18 years old, and that was what I knew. All the way through my twenties I was trying very hard to keep myself the same, because another thing I heard a lot growing up was people saying, “you’re so great, never change”.

In November 2019, McGregor was on the cover of Men's Journal and he talked about being with Winstead. He said, “Lighter? Today? As opposed to then? I am better. I am happier. I think that’s true.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the last couple of years, Mary Elizabeth Winstead doesn't seem to have said much about Ewan McGregor. It's possible that she wants to maintain some privacy since her divorce from Riley Stearns was very public.</p><p>Winstead is also busy as a mom to a young child, and it sounds like she and McGregor are having fun sharing their Hollywood careers with their child. In September 2023, she told Entertainment Weekly that her son loves Star Wars, which is cool since she was cast in Ahoska.</p><p>Winstead said of her son, "He's got Star Wars friends all over the place — like Grogu dolls everywhere that he's obsessed with. It's been a part of our lives for a while now."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicsJmeYrqks9GenqiqXaKus8WMnqOispGXsrW0jLCgp6ukmq6lv4yfoKurpGK1tr%2FBmqWdZaKeuabFjKyrnpmio8BusMivpqublWQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fewan-mcgregor-severely-complicated-mary-elizabeth-winstead-s-divorce-from-her-first-husband-riley.html&text=Ewan%20McGregor%20Severely%20Complicated%20Mary%20Elizabeth%20Winsteads%20Divorce%20From%20Her%20First%20Husband%20Riley%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fewan-mcgregor-severely-complicated-mary-elizabeth-winstead-s-divorce-from-her-first-husband-riley.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fewan-mcgregor-severely-complicated-mary-elizabeth-winstead-s-divorce-from-her-first-husband-riley.html&title=Ewan%20McGregor%20Severely%20Complicated%20Mary%20Elizabeth%20Winsteads%20Divorce%20From%20Her%20First%20Husband%20Riley%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fewan-mcgregor-severely-complicated-mary-elizabeth-winstead-s-divorce-from-her-first-husband-riley.html&title=Ewan%20McGregor%20Severely%20Complicated%20Mary%20Elizabeth%20Winsteads%20Divorce%20From%20Her%20First%20Husband%20Riley%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fewan-mcgregor-severely-complicated-mary-elizabeth-winstead-s-divorce-from-her-first-husband-riley.html&title=Ewan%20McGregor%20Severely%20Complicated%20Mary%20Elizabeth%20Winsteads%20Divorce%20From%20Her%20First%20Husband%20Riley%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fewan-mcgregor-severely-complicated-mary-elizabeth-winstead-s-divorce-from-her-first-husband-riley.html&description=Ewan%20McGregor%20Severely%20Complicated%20Mary%20Elizabeth%20Winsteads%20Divorce%20From%20Her%20First%20Husband%20Riley%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ice-cube-net-worth-how-much-is-ice-cube-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ice Cube Net Worth  How Much is Ice Cube Worth?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./bumper-robinson-net-worth-how-much-is-bumper-robinson-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bumper Robinson Net Worth  How Much is Bumper Robinson Worth?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
