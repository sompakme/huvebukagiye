Chris Pratt has made several blockbuster films, including The Lego Movie, Avengers: Endgame and <a href=#>one of his best films;</a><a href=#> Jurassic World</a>. Surprisingly, none of these big films required him to ride a horse until The Magnificent Seven came along. Pratt said before filming that movie he had bad luck with horses.</p><p>One of the most horrible experiences he had with horses came when he tried to show off his riding prowess to a girl he was dating. “I actually had to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">get rescued one time by the girl I was dating</a>. We were on horses on this beach, and it was supposed to be romantic.” However, <strong>the experience was far from romantic because of Pratt's cockiness,</strong> and it also ruined his relationship. In this article, we will examine what happened when Pratt went horse riding with his ex-girlfriend and his romantic relationships after that experience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chris-pratt-almost-died-while-on-vacation-with-his-ex-girlfriend>Chris Pratt Almost Died While On Vacation With His Ex-Girlfriend</h2><p>While on Late Night With Seth Meyers, to promote his latest project, the Guardians of the Galaxy actor revealed he almost died while on vacation while riding a horse. Pratt explained <strong>he had gotten cocky about his horse riding skills, and it almost led to his death. </strong>He told Meyers he had always had a contentious relationship with horses growing up because he treated them like ‘jet-skis’ instead of living animals.</p><p>"I didn't fully put together that it was a living animal, I would just jump... and also my confidence would quickly outgrow my skill."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/instar51730760.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before he began dating Anna Faris, Pratt had an ex-girlfriend who loved horses. Once, they decided to go on a romantic vacation and ride horses on the beach. Because he was so cocky about his skills, Pratt ended up in a horrible situation when the horse he was riding took off running, and his feet came up on the stirrups.</p><p>"My feet were up in the air, my head was bouncing off the horse's ass, I was seconds away from death."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/chris-pratt-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Fans Accuse Chris Pratt Of Purposely Insulting Ex-Wife Anna Faris">Fans Accuse Chris Pratt Of Purposely Insulting Ex-Wife Anna Faris</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Chris Pratt upset fans after he seemingly dissed his ex -wife Anna Faris for a second time.</p><p>At that moment, Pratt felt like he was going to die. Luckily, his girlfriend at the time knew how to talk to horses and swooped in to save his life. The actor admitted he only survived because of her skills, but their relationship did not survive the embarrassing ordeal. "In that moment, we broke up in my head."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite Chris Pratt’s near-death experience with horses during that vacation, he didn’t let it stop him from playing characters who had to ride the beautiful creatures. He was on Seth Meyers’ promoting his latest Western movie called The Magnificent Seven. In the movie, Pratt rides horses in several scenes, so it's safe to say he got over his scary experience with horses and got back to riding.</p><h2 id=who-are-chris-pratt-rsquo-s-ex-girlfriends>Who Are Chris Pratt’s Ex-Girlfriends</h2><p>Long before Chris Pratt began <a href=#>starring in films that grossed hundreds of millions at the box office,</a> he was often spotted with his Take Me Home Tonight co-star, Anna Farris.

The two began dating in December 2018, shortly after he finalized his divorce from Faris. <strong>A few months later, Pratt and Katherine were already engaged and married</strong>. In an adorable photo he posted to Instagram, Pratt said of his new partner,</p><p>"Your smile lights up the room. I've cherished our time together.
