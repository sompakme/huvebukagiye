Once a new fan discovers how hilarious Hartman was, they are invariably left with one question. How did Phil Hartman die? As it turns out, Hartman left his fortune to the same person who took his life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/phil-hartman-from-newsradio.jpg><p>On May 28, 1998, the world became a lot less funny when Phil Hartman tragically passed away because his wife Brynn Hartman took his life. For fans of the comedy genius, it was an extremely hard pill to swallow that the actor was gone.</p><p>Within days of Hartman's tragic passing, his fans were hit with another blow when news about his estate became public. According to a Los Angeles Times report from June 3rd, 1998, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Phil Hartman left his entire estate to his wife who took his life</a>.</p><p>"'NewsRadio' star Phil Hartman left everything to his wife, who k*lled him and then herself last week at the couple’s Encino estate, according to copies of the couple’s wills filed Tuesday for probate in Los Angeles Superior Court."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/kevin-o-leary-looking-angry.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Kevin O'Leary's Net Worth Won't Go To His Children When He Dies, Here's Who'll Get It Instead</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Kevin O'Leary's children don't get any money when he dies but his fortune will still go to his family in an interesting way.</span><p>Since Phil Hartman was such a beloved figure, people continue to look back on his life and death. One example of that is a 2023 Yahoo! article that detailed how the hilarious actor lost his life far too early in life.</p><p>That article claimed that the Hartmans always seemed like a very happy couple from the outside looking in. The article even quoted a bartender who was familiar with the couple and told People that they always seemed happy from afar.</p><p>"They always held hands and laughed and seemed like they were having a good time.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/saturday-night-live-cast-photoshoot.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, according to what Phil Hartman's former lawyer, Steve Small, told the Los Angeles Times in 1998, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">things were a lot more rocky behind closed doors</a>. "[Brynn] had trouble controlling her anger. Phil said he had to . . . restrain her at times."</p><p>Due to that drama, Phil and Brynn Hartman separated multiple times. It has also been reported that Brynn Hartman had substance abuse issues.</p><p>In 1998, a coroner revealed what had been discovered by Brynn Hartman's autopsy. According to the coroner's report, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brynn Hartman was under the influence</a> of two substances and alcohol when she took her husband's life. After Phil Hartman took his final breath, Brynn Hartman's life also ended at her own hand.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/did-mick-jagger-and-keith-richards-really-share-a-girlfriend-who-mothered-some-of-the-guitarist-s-children_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Did Mick Jagger And Keith Richards Really Share A Girlfriend Who Mothered Some Of The Guitarist's Children?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Anita Pallenberg dated Mick Jagger and Keith Richards and gave birth to several of the guitarist's children.</span><p>Since Brynn Hartman's life ended the same night as Phil Hartman's did, she obviously couldn't inherit his fortune.
