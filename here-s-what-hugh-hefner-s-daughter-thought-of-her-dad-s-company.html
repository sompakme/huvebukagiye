But in addition to being a celebrity in the adult world, Hugh was also a dad of four. Two of his kids were born in the 50s, but he had a second set in the '90s with another wife, Kimberley Conrad. The second set, two boys, grew up in a mansion next door to Playboy's headquarters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But in 2017, Hugh passed away, and Playboy changed a lot.&nbsp;Some of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hugh's kids are emulating his legacy</a>,&nbsp;though not all are deeply involved in the 'family business.'</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Is Hugh Hefner's Son Cooper, And What Does He Do?</a></span></p><p>Hugh's kids were understandably distraught when the patriarch passed. After all, he was very involved with his kids' lives. But <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Crystal, his last wife, was also troubled afterward</a>.</p><p>It was rough on everyone, but Hugh's kids have been surprisingly normal since. But their childhoods weren't quite like the average family's. In fact, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Redditors</a> found out that Hugh's daughter Christie had a particular view of the organization her father ran, and the Playboy Mansion, in particular.</p><p>An old article in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Magazine</a> -- circa 1982 -- highlighted parts of Christie's childhood that were really surprising to fans (and critics). As Redditors summed up, Christie used to visit the Playboy Mansion as a child.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans will recall that Christie is now an adult (she was born in 1952), so it was early days at Playboy when she was hanging around the Mansion as a teen. But she didn't really understand exactly what was happening inside Playboy's doors at the time.</p><p>Redditors recapped that when Christie would visi, the "mansion was cleaned up" and the "kinky" stuff was put away.</p><p>Hiding things from Christie didn't last that long, though. After she became an adult, Christie actually became the president of Playboy. But when she was a teen, her dad was involved with Barbi Benton, who Christie said seemed like a perfectly nice girlfriend to her father.</p><p>She said that when she visited the Mansion, the highlight was pinball machines that you didn't have to put quarters in. The teen thought it was awesome, and although her mom had once said that Christie was "jealous" of all the women giving her dad attention, Christie herself told&nbsp;New York Magazine that she thought the Mansion was "wonderful."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's nice to know that even through all the years of the media dragging Hugh Hefner, Christie felt like her dad's house was great and that it was "nice to see someone enjoying the fruits of their labors."</p><p>Not to mention, it was nice having a career to slide into once Christie finished up her illustrious education in Massachusetts!</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's Who Inherited Most Of Hugh Hefner's Estate And Where They Are Now</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrW2s8dmn56enpq%2FbrDArp6hrJWnerW0zq6eoaxdpLNuvMuasJunqWQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhere-s-what-hugh-hefner-s-daughter-thought-of-her-dad-s-company.html&text=Here%27s%20What%20Hugh%20Hefner%27s%20Daughter%20Thought%20Of%20Her%20Dad%27s%20Company&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhere-s-what-hugh-hefner-s-daughter-thought-of-her-dad-s-company.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhere-s-what-hugh-hefner-s-daughter-thought-of-her-dad-s-company.html&title=Here%27s%20What%20Hugh%20Hefner%27s%20Daughter%20Thought%20Of%20Her%20Dad%27s%20Company" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhere-s-what-hugh-hefner-s-daughter-thought-of-her-dad-s-company.html&title=Here%27s%20What%20Hugh%20Hefner%27s%20Daughter%20Thought%20Of%20Her%20Dad%27s%20Company" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhere-s-what-hugh-hefner-s-daughter-thought-of-her-dad-s-company.html&title=Here%27s%20What%20Hugh%20Hefner%27s%20Daughter%20Thought%20Of%20Her%20Dad%27s%20Company" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhere-s-what-hugh-hefner-s-daughter-thought-of-her-dad-s-company.html&description=Here%27s%20What%20Hugh%20Hefner%27s%20Daughter%20Thought%20Of%20Her%20Dad%27s%20Company" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./here-s-what-eazy-e-s-daughter-thinks-of-straight-outta-compton.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Heres What Eazy-Es Daughter Thinks Of Straight Outta Compton">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./benedict-cumberbatch-children-meet-hal-auden-cumberbatch-christopher-carlton-cumberbatch-and-finn.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Benedict Cumberbatch Children: Meet Hal Auden Cumberbatch, Christopher Carlton Cumberbatch, And Finn">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
