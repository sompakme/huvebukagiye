In recent years, through social media platforms, there has been an influx of young and upcoming musicians vying for their space in the music industry. One of them is Mike Sherm, a rapper, who got his start through the music sharing website SoundCloud.</p><p>Before SoundCloud, aspiring musicians trolled the streets and knocked on the doors of music executives, hoping for a chance but through the platform, talents like Mike Sherm have seized control of their development, taking their music directly to music fans and inadvertently, developing a following that makes music executives chase them instead.</p><p>How far Mike will go remains to be seen, but he is well on a path to become a music superstar. Read all about his life and career progression here.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=mike-sherm-biography-and-age></span><strong>Mike Sherm Biography and Age</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Canada is not generally known to be the home of rappers, even though it can boast of Drake as one of its superstars, but it has been one of the leading countries with the highest number of citizens who are global music stars, and if Mike Sherm’s talent is anything to go by, he might soon join the illustrious list.</p><p>Mike was born on the 30th of September, 1996 in Montreal, Quebec but was raised by his parents in Victoria, British Columbia. Although we do not know much of his background, he is believed to have left his family at the age of 14 for reasons that are yet unknown.</p><p>His education history remains a mystery but he began to write music at the age of 10 and it has been the ever-present companion of the Montreal-born rapper through his growth into adulthood. In 2012, he began uploading some of his songs to global platforms like SoundCloud and YouTube and thus began a journey that has led to performances at the Rolling Loud Tour. Some of his early tacks include Stuck Up, Cookies, A-Hole, Bands On Me, and a couple of others, all of which attracted the attention of music producers, fans and executives, enough to earn him his first record deal with FLVR Records.</p><p>He was signed to FLVR Records in 2017 and has since released his first studio album titled, Back Around. The album saw Mike Sherm expand the popularity of his work through collaboration with other artists like Moka Only, Prada West, Larceny, Merkules, and a couple more others.</p><p>A rapper known for different rhyme styles and a sharp wit, Mike Sherm is part of a modern crop of hip hop artists who have developed a following across all demographics. From Caucasians to African Americans hip hop fans, it reflects on his social media profile, such as his Instagram where he has over 190 thousand followers and on YouTube with over 280 thousand subscribers.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=personal-life></span><strong>Personal Life</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Although he is still a rising talent, Mike Sherm’s love life has already drawn interest from his growing pool of fans who would like to know the lucky man or woman in the rapper’s life. So far, there hasn’t been an answer to the question and although there are a group of people who consider his reluctance to share his personal life to be proof he is a gay man, the rapper hasn’t made any admission of the sort and he is generally considered to be straight.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=mike-sherms-height></span><strong>Mike Sherm’s Height</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Unfortunately, his exact height hasn’t yet been determined but an eye test through his music videos and pictures suggests Mike Sherm is somewhere between 5 feet 10 inches and 6 feet 2 inches. His body weight is measured to be 73kg, a healthy and appropriate weight for a man his size.</p><p>His physical look as that of an athlete suggests Mike Sherm spends time in the gym. Other noticeable body features he has include black hair and dark brown eyes.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=other-facts-about-mike-sherm></span><strong>Other Facts About Mike Sherm</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>Although still a growing artist, his album sales and concerts have earned him a net worth in the region of $800 thousand.</li><li>With his career still on the rise, he is expected to be worth a lot more in the near future.</li><li>Mike Sherm has collaborated with fellow rappers, SOB X RBE for the song, Knockdown.</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaGpgZ35uuciknGarmJq%2FrnnAoJxmoJWetKnAjJ%2BYnKyjYq6ju9StZK2glWK6tr%2FInJilZZGnwaq%2F02g%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmike-sherm-age-height-facts-about-the-musical-artist.html&text=Mike%20Sherm%20%20Age%2c%20Height%20%26amp%3b%20Facts%20About%20The%20Musical%20Artist&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmike-sherm-age-height-facts-about-the-musical-artist.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmike-sherm-age-height-facts-about-the-musical-artist.html&title=Mike%20Sherm%20%20Age%2c%20Height%20%26amp%3b%20Facts%20About%20The%20Musical%20Artist" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmike-sherm-age-height-facts-about-the-musical-artist.html&title=Mike%20Sherm%20%20Age%2c%20Height%20%26amp%3b%20Facts%20About%20The%20Musical%20Artist" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmike-sherm-age-height-facts-about-the-musical-artist.html&title=Mike%20Sherm%20%20Age%2c%20Height%20%26amp%3b%20Facts%20About%20The%20Musical%20Artist" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmike-sherm-age-height-facts-about-the-musical-artist.html&description=Mike%20Sherm%20%20Age%2c%20Height%20%26amp%3b%20Facts%20About%20The%20Musical%20Artist" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-10-highest-grossing-indie-films-of-all-time.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The 10 Highest-Grossing Indie Films of All Time">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./lisa-marie-presley-news-us-weekly.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lisa Marie Presley News - Us Weekly">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
