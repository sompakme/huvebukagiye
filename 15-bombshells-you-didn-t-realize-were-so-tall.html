What's the average height of a woman? Well, it's around five feet five inches. Not here. Our average is around five feet 11 inches and a bit. Get ready to meet some hot bombshells that you (literally) have to look up to. But let's put this into perspective. In four or five inch heels, these babes are as tall as pro basketball players. In fact, if an average height person is standing facing one of these bombshells, their eye level view are those spectacular breasts and cleavage. Sure, we know you know we'll have some models, actresses and athletes. But, we've gone beyond the usual fare and have included royalty, an adult star or two, a reality star, as well as some WWE divas and even a transgender bombshell. Don't worry ours is not called Caitlyn. And, believe it or not, we've even got a totally hot and outrageous aristocratic race car driver. We kid you not. And, yes, everybody knows<a href=#> Taylor Swift</a> is tall. We promise you a Taylor-Swift-free list. Here are 15 tall babes you will probably have to look up to if you meet them. Or, you could go for the eye level view. Your choice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=stacy-keibler---5-feet-11-inches>15. Stacy Keibler - 5 Feet 11 Inches</h2><p>When <a href=#>Stacy Keibler</a> was on&nbsp;Dancing with the Stars, outspoken Italian&nbsp;judge <a href=#>Bruno Tonioli </a>called her a "weapon of mass seduction". He comes out with that kind of stuff a lot. Now, it takes some kind of woman to make <a href=#>George Clooney</a> look small, but she managed to do just that with considerable style and grace for the two years they dated. This woman has modeled, acted and been a standout WWE diva. In fact her unusually long legs have landed her the title of the "Legs of the WWE". She's right up there with the tallest divas. Got an image of a hot babe in between the sheets? The girl works so hard she has famously said, "I&nbsp;don't do much in my bedroom besides sleep. I walk in and pass out." Pity. Maybe that's why it didn't work out with George.</p><h2 id=kate-middleton---5-feet-10-inches>14. Kate Middleton - 5 Feet 10 Inches</h2><p>Okay. This was a few years ago when she was "the girlfriend" and she went roller skating in hot pants. She'd probably prefer you forget it.&nbsp;<a href=#>Kate Middleton</a> is the commoner who worked very hard to snag her prince (some say too hard) and became a princess. You could be forgiven for forgetting just how tall she is. Standing next to her six foot three inches hubby <a href=#>Prince William</a>, she looks "average". Average this lady is not. She's brought style and modernity into the Royal circles. But still, we (and everybody else) can't help but notice all those skirts-in-the-air wardrobe malfunctions. Hey, we are not complaining one little bit. Nor are we complaining about those nude vacation pictures that made the round of the tabloids a few years ago. When they were dating, William took so long to propose, she was dubbed "Waity Katie". Back then she roller skated in hot pants and went to parties wearing bunny ears. Those were the days.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=laverne-cox---5-feet-11-inches>13. Laverne Cox - 5 Feet 11 Inches</h2><p>Laverne Cox, of&nbsp;Orange is the New Black&nbsp;fame, is a transgender bombshell and an in your face advocate of LGBT rights. Sophia Burset, her character on the show, is transgender and camp and does hair. Well, the thing is not many people realize that Laverne was born Roderick (either in 1972 or 1984, depending on who you talk to) way down in sunny Mobile, Alabama and has a twin brother who (wait for it) played the pre-transition Sophia in one episode of the show. Got that? He played Sophia while she was still a he. Yes, it is confusing. Read it over a couple of times. You'll get there. Laverne does a mean stage act that involves tassels and pasties&nbsp;that you've got to see to believe. She even got an Emmy nomination.</p><h2 id=blake-lively---5-feet-10-inches>12. Blake Lively - 5 Feet 10 Inches</h2><p>Believe it or not, <a href=#>Blake Lively</a> is self-conscious about her nearly six foot frame. She is famously loved up with Ryan Reynolds and mother of two. But, as all those skin tight wet suits and bikinis she wore in 2016's&nbsp;The Shallows&nbsp;prove, she is probably in the best shape of her life. And she gave that pesky shark a run for his money. It must be all that clean living. She doesn't drink or do drugs and is something of a homebody, saying "I don't want to go to a club and not wear panties." Well, that's a relief. She is the kind of All-American girl who was class president and a cheerleader. You know, the popular girl who probably dated jocks and that all the un-cool girls hated.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=michelle-mccool---5-feet-11-inches>11. Michelle McCool - 5 Feet 11 Inches</h2><p>WWE fans will know <a href=#>Michelle McCool</a>&nbsp;well. For those of you who are not (yet) fans of the WWE, you should know that some think watching the divas do their stuff is the best fun you can have with your clothes on. Except the divas tend not to wear much usually. Which is one of the reasons it is so much fun. Anyway, after more broken bones than you can shake a stick at, Michelle retired from wrestling a while back. Her hubby is a wrestler called The Undertaker. You know, because he supposedly terminates his rivals. Michelle was no pushover herself and was WWE Divas Champion on more than one occasion. When&nbsp;Playboy&nbsp;came calling with cash for a nude photoshoot, she said thanks but no thanks. At the time she said "For now, I'll be keeping my clothes on." We're focusing on "for now" and live in hope.</p><h2 id=ciara---5-feet-10-inches>10. Ciara - 5 Feet 10 Inches</h2><p>The rumor was that Seattle Seahawks quarterback <a href=#>Russell Wilson</a>&nbsp;cried after doing the deed&nbsp;with the tall and gorgeous singer for the first time. Wait for this. It was after they were married. Now there's something different to consider: Celebrities who wait until after they are married to do the deed. Anyway, reportedly it wasn't true. The crying bit anyway. Just so you know, they got married in a castle in England. No word on where the crying didn't take place. Before Wilson, gorgeous Ciara was (some say improbably) all loved up with not so gorgeous (some say plain out ugly) rapper <a href=#>Future</a>. These days they just sue one another and fight over custody of their kid.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=giselle-bundchen---5-feet-11-inches>9. Giselle Bundchen - 5 Feet 11 Inches</h2><p>Boy did she ever look happy walking across the football field after hubby <a href=#>Tom Brady</a> pulled off that Super Bowl victory in a totally tense overtime battle. Gisele Bundchen is the kind of mom who breast feeds a baby while being made up for a glamorous photoshoot. Just your average tall and gorgeous supermodel turned mom. Just a smudge under six feet, this Brazilian beauty gives as good as she takes in those (rumored) fights with (rumor alert) nasty tempered Brady. Now, the question has got to be, will soon-to-be-40 Brady hang up his jersey and chill, making life easier for his wife and kids? Word is you shouldn't hold your breath. Stand tall, Giselle. You're a natural.</p><h2 id=ireland-baldwin---6-feet-2-inches>8. Ireland Baldwin - 6 Feet 2 Inches</h2><p>When your gene pool comes from a mom like the totally hot actress Kim Basinger and the suave actor <a href=#>Alec Baldwin,</a> you've probably already got a head start in life. If she were not so tall, we could call <a href=#>Ireland Baldwin</a> up and coming. She is six feet two inches of modeling and acting talent that just won't quit. She's the kind of babe who has lotus flower tattoos and dates a world champion surfer. And when they wanted somebody to play the younger version of the character Kim Basinger was playing in a 2013 movie, guess who they called? She pretty regularly posts in the buff&nbsp;and nearly nude shots to her Instagram account. And just to make certain we take note, she uses Ireland Basinger-Baldwin there.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=khloe-kardashian---5-feet-10-inches>7. Khloe Kardashian - 5 Feet 10 Inches</h2><p>You know all those ads the Kardashian sisters do to sell jeans or whatever? You might have noticed that usually Khloe's five feet ten inch height is Photoshopped down to the same size as her much shorter siblings. So they are all like even. The other thing to tell you about <a href=#>Khloe Kardashian</a> is there is just this persistent rumor that her real dad was not lawyer Robert Kardashian, but rather his friend and client in the murder trial of the century, one <a href=#>O.J. Simpson</a>. Let's be diplomatic. The young <a href=#>Kris Kardashian</a> was quite a "goer" when it came to (usually) younger guys and many say that even Robert Kardashian wondered if O.J. had slipped between the sheets with a wild Kris, saying she was very dark.</p><h2 id=charlize-theron---5-feet-10-inches>6. Charlize Theron - 5 Feet 10 Inches</h2><p>The tall and statuesque actress hails from South Africa. On paper, she had a happy, idyllic childhood. On paper. Back when she was a school girl, her mother shot and killed her father. Her story was that her dad was drunk, abusive and threatening, and that her mom Gerda shot him in self-defense. Not so, says his family who say, at one point, Gerda shot him in the back while he was lying on the floor. Anyway, pretty early on Gerda was pushing her tall and beautiful daughter to succeed in a big way, entering her in modeling competitions from an early age. So, Charlize ended up in Hollywood with not much money and (rumor alert) was sleeping around when an agent noticed her pitching a fit in a bank and signed her. She returned the favor: Just as her career got going, she dumped him. Thanks for everything.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=anna-nicole-smith---5-feet-11-inches>5. Anna Nicole Smith - 5 Feet 11 Inches</h2><p>It's been ten years, almost to the day, since Anna Nicole Smith died in a luxurious Florida hotel of "combined drug intoxication". She was only 39-years old. Of her three marriages, most remember the one in 1994 to filthy rich J. Howard Marshall who, at 89-years-old was some sixty-two years older than the new Mrs. Marshall. You would be right in thinking that the blonde bombshell who channeled a <a href=#>Marilyn Monroe</a> vibe was featured in Playboy. In fact she was Playmate of the Year in 1993. Marshall died only a year or two after they married (don't worry, of natural causes). With all the money he left, it will surprise no one that what then ensued was an unholy row about who&nbsp;got what from his estate. Anna Nicole ended up losing out big time and had to declare bankruptcy. Still to come: One adult star and a hot race car driver.</p><h2 id=maria-sharapova---6-feet-2-inches>4. Maria Sharapova - 6 Feet 2 Inches</h2><p>We just had to include one tennis star. Well, we didn't have to, but if you are doing a tall bombshell list, you would be pretty dumb not to include the six foot two bad girl of tennis <a href=#>Maria Sharapova</a>. After all, she's not only won Wimbledon, but also has been featured in luscious bikinis in the&nbsp;Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue.&nbsp;She has had her ups and downs and an injury-prone career, but hit rock bottom in 2016 when she flunked a drug test at the Australian Open and was suspended for 15 months. She'll be back, we bet. She's too interesting to lose. After all, she's the kind of babe who dates the likes of Maroon 5 singer <a href=#>Adam Levine</a>. And then there is her candy line called (wait for it) Sugarpova.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jodie-kidd---6-feet-1-inch>3. Jodie Kidd - 6 Feet 1 Inch</h2><p>And finally, one hot race car driver by the name of Jodie Kidd. Doesn't look much like a racer, does she? Racy, yes. She comes from a long line of English aristocrats. Her family is full of dukes, barons and baronets. So well-heeled and posh. She first hit the limelight when she started modeling at 15-years-old. Many said her too-skinny frame sent out the wrong message to young girls. So, she put on a bit of weight and they shut up. She has a love of cars and speed and she set a record when she drove the Celebrity Lap on BBC's popular car show&nbsp;Top Gear.&nbsp;She's even&nbsp;gone on to win a competitive race or two. Imagine that six foot plus frame&nbsp;rising out of a Maserati. She's the kind of classy broad who has babies with Argentinian polo players. We kid you not.</p><h2 id=angel-long---6-feet>2. Angel Long - 6 Feet</h2><p>This tall, leggy English blonde is probably very tired, having done some 220 adult films over her hardcore career in adult films. You know, all that exercise gets to you. Our favorite has to be&nbsp;Titney Spheres: How I Shagged My Way to the Top.&nbsp;She's the kind of babe who will tell you flat out that she loves being an exhibitionist. We like her already. Had it not been for adult films, she could have cleaned up as a stripper. Or as a Britney Spears imitator. On-screen, she has progressed from playing naughty teenagers to playing naughty college students. Before nakedness, s*x and the like became her life when she was in her early twenties, she worked as a nanny (fantasy-time) and in construction. She's gorgeous, built and six feet of total wow.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=famke-janssen---6-feet>1. Famke Janssen - 6 Feet</h2><p>The&nbsp;X-Men&nbsp;star and former Bond Girl, stands tall at six feet. She was vixen Jean Grey in X-Men&nbsp;and played a too-hot-to-handle assassin opposite Pierce Brosnan's 007. She had plenty of hot moves, both vertically and horizontally. You know what we mean. A few years back, she got totally weird when she claimed her New York City penthouse had been broken into (by window washers?) and that someone had left a creepy-horror children's book from the 1950s on her bedside table. It was, she said, a "message". And not a nice one. 'WTF', the world replied. Only thing was there was no sign of a break-in and police later decided (diplomatically) that Ms. Janssen had just been confused or mistaken. Oh, well.
