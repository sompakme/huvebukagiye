Rather, it was simply a matter of growing apart with time. "We probably don't get as real as we needed to as we do now,” Courteney previously said in an interview with Howard Stern.</p><p>“There are a lot of things that David likes to do completely the opposite things I do,” She went on. “I'm a homebody.

And that can be great for a lot of things, but I need this kind of real, one-on-one connection."</p><p>Also, during her conversation with Howard Stern, Courteney revealed that their sexual needs and preferences also became an issue. “It was early in the morning," Courteney recalled of one instance. This is one of our problems in our relationship. Whenever I would need consoling from David, he could not literally put his arm around me for one second without completely getting a boner."</p><p>"[He] was never like, 'Oh, I'm so sorry your Dad is dying.
