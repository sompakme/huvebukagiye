One of these highly successful contestants includes the much loved Harry Jowsey, who is well known for his bubbly personality and charming looks. The influencer featured in Season 1, where he went on to win the cash prize with his partner at the time Francesca Farago.</p><p>Since then, he has made his mark in LA, befriending some of the most well-known influencers alongside earning himself a fairly decent amount of money along the way. However, just how much has he earned exactly?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="'OnlyFans': Harry Jowsey Reveals Unusual Request That Helped Him Earn $1M">'OnlyFans': Harry Jowsey Reveals Unusual Request That Helped Him Earn $1M</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=harry-jowsey-grew-to-fame-thanks-to-netflix-39-s-reality-series>Harry Jowsey Grew To Fame Thanks To Netflix's Reality Series</h2><p>Reality TV star Harry Jowsey is more famously known for appearing on Netflix's Too Hot To Handle. Upon leaving the villa in Mexico, he found himself diving headfirst into the unknown world of fame. His following had increased by millions, and the star now had over 4 million followers at his fingertips, a significant increase in comparison to his previous follower count before joining the show.</p><p>However, even before appearing on Too Hot To Handle, the star had already had a little taste of fame across the Pacific in his home country of Australia. Jowsey had previously made an appearance on an Australian dating show, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Heartbreak Island</a>, where he won the $100,000 cash prize with his partner at the time, Georgia Bryers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Both of these reality TV appearances helped Jowsey to grow in popularity and fame, as well as increase his online presence via social media. He soon realized that he had a golden opportunity to monetize his social media following, and that's exactly what he did next.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Exclusive: How 'THTH' Star Harry Jowsey Is Building Businesses That Make A Difference">Exclusive: How 'THTH' Star Harry Jowsey Is Building Businesses That Make A Difference</a></span></p><h2 id=what-is-harry-jowsey-39-s-net-worth>What Is Harry Jowsey's Net Worth?</h2><p>According to Fame Ranker, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harry Jowsey has an estimated net worth of $4.5 million</a>. Much of this is thanks to his newfound fame from appearing on Too Hot To Handle, which has allowed him to heavily monetize his Instagram and other social media platforms to his advantage. The much-loved reality TV star currently has 4.4 million followers on Instagram as of 2022, as well as enjoying a particularly high engagement rate on the platform, racking up hundreds and thousands of likes on the platform.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With such a large pool of fans at his fingertips, Jowsey can easily demand up to five figures for a single sponsored post on Instagram. Even more shocking is the reported amount he's earned off the platform so far, with estimated figures being calculated at $562,062 dollars as of 2021.</p><p>This is a staggering amount considering he starred on Too Hot To Handle only a year prior. In addition, he also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">has his own podcast on YouTube</a>, which brings him some spare income each month.</p><p>In previous interviews, Jowsey has <a href=#>mentioned that he would be interested in doing another reality TV show</a> sometime in the future, which could potentially give a boost to his net worth if it is something the star decides to pursue. However, since his success on Too Hot To Handle, he's already done pretty well for himself we'd say.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In terms of making a positive change, the star has <a href=#>spoken passionately about how he wants to create companies that make a positive change</a>; that he wants to give back as much as he can.

However, who has the highest net worth out of all the contestants?</p><p>Well, it may come as no surprise, but fan-favorite Harry Jowsey is the contestant with the highest net worth on the show. As previously mentioned, his net worth sits at $4.5 million dollars, the highest out of all those who have starred in the reality series. Runner-up to Jowsey is his former ex-girlfriend Francesca Farago, with an estimated net worth of $3 million dollars. Just like her former lover, Farago also found herself with a large fan base at her fingertips after leaving the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, it may be surprising to some that <a href=#>the cast members don't actually get paid to be on the show</a>.
