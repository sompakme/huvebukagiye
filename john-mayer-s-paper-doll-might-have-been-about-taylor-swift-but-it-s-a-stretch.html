From comments he has publicly made during interviews to details of how he treated his significant others during their relationships coming to light, <a href=#>it is no wonder that his exes do not think very highly of him</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, the most vocal of Mayer's exes is <strong><a href=#>Taylor Swift</a></strong>. The two met and began an unconfirmed relationship when Swift was 19 and the Gravity singer was 32 years old. The relationship sparked out of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mayer's wanting to collaborate with the Bad Blood singer on a song he had written</a>, "Half of My Heart."</p><p>"Waking up to this song idea that won't leave my head," Mayer tweeted. "3 days straight now. That means it's good enough to finish," he wrote. "It's called Half of My Heart and I want to sing it with Taylor Swift. She would make a killer Stevie Nicks in contrast to my Tom Petty of a song."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>After Constant Criticism Of His Love Life, John Mayer Claims He Doesn't Date Anymore</a></span></p><p>The two would go on to date from all reports until 2010. But then things went south and appeared to go south quickly. As a result, "Dear John" was written, and it was clear who the song was about without any explanation from Swift.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, the same could not be said for Mayer's alleged response released in 2013. And this is why some fans believe John Mayer's "Paper Doll" might have been about Taylor Swift, but it is a stretch.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-notably-wrote-quot-dear-john-quot-about-john-mayer>Taylor Swift Notably Wrote "Dear John" About John Mayer</h2><p>There is speculation as to when Swift and Mayer's relationship ended. Some believe it was early 2010, while others believe it is more likely the relationship did not officially become a thing of the past until the summer of that year.</p><p>What everyone can agree on, however, is that when "Dear John" was released in October 2010, the two were not only over but not on speaking terms. And while it was obvious to fans who the song was about, Swift would not confirm it at the time, only <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">speaking about how difficult the song was for her to write</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/untitled-design-1-2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"A lot of times when people's relationships end, they write an email to that person and say everything that they wish they would have said," Swift explained. "A lot of times they don't push send."</p><p>But, Swift would muster up the courage and end up "pushing send" to create "Dear John," despite it being "a tough one to write."</p><p>When pressed about who the song was about, the "Blank Space" singer made it clear on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she would not be naming names</a>, no matter how many times she was asked about the identity of the person being sung about in "Dear John."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Some Taylor Swift Songs Aren't As Subliminal As Fans Might Have Suspected</a></span></p><p>"I'm still going to continue to write about my life and I guess people are going to continue to speculate about it," Swift explained. "And I'm going to continue to never tell them what the song's about."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But given the Easter eggs that were left in the song and the timing of when it was released, plus the fact that John Mayer is Taylor's only "John" ex, fans immediately guessed that the song was about none other than Mayer.</p><h2 id=fans-think-john-mayer-wrote-quot-paper-doll-quot-about-taylor-swift>Fans Think John Mayer Wrote "Paper Doll" About Taylor Swift</h2><p>What is not so clear is whether Mayer truly wrote a response song to "Dear John." But given the Waiting on the World to Change singer's reaction to the song, many Swift fans believe <a href=#>"Paper Doll" was written to counter what had been said in Swift's emotional song</a>.</p><p>In 2012, Mayer finally spoke out about Swift's song. Not only did he claim he was "humiliated" by what the Shake It Off singer sang about in "Dear John," but he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">had some choice words to say about Swift as well</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/john-mayer-in-an-interview.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It made me feel terrible," Mayer explained. "Because I didn't deserve it. I'm pretty good about taking accountability now, and I never did anything to deserve that. It was a really lousy thing for her to do."</p><p>Perhaps feeling like he had been villainized unfairly, the only way that Mayer could tell his side of the story was with "Paper Doll." Because Mayer has never discussed who the song is or is not about, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">speculation is all fans have to hold onto at this point</a>.</p><p>"The song never got listened to as a song," Mayer explained. "It became a news story because of the lyrics. I’m not in the business of telling people what the song’s about."</p><p>Given that both songs were written over a decade ago, the hope is that both have moved on and are not holding any grudges. And based on Swift's comments before playing "Dear John" for the first time live in years, it appears that is the case.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=john-mayer-has-long-since-moved-on-and-so-has-taylor-swift>John Mayer Has Long Since Moved On, And So Has Taylor Swift</h2><p>After Scooter Braun stole Swift's music and <a href=#>subsequently lost a fortune from doing so</a>, Swift has been recording her songs dated prior to 2019, <a href=#>thanks in part to Kelly Clarkson</a>. The most recently finished re-recorded album is Speak Now where "Dear John" resides.</p><p>And prior to playing the song for the first time in years, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swift asked fans to be kind to the person they thought the song was about</a>.</p><p>"I was hoping to ask you, that as we lead up to this album coming out, I would love for that kindness and that gentleness to extend onto our internet activities," Swift asked of her fans.</p><p>“So what I'm trying to say is, I'm putting this album out because I want to own my music and I believe that any artist who has the desire to own their music should be able to. That's why I'm putting out this album."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/john-mayer-avoiding-the-paparazzi.jpg><p><a href=#>Swift went on to say</a>, "I’m 33 years old, I don’t care about anything that happened to me when I was 19 except the songs I wrote and the memories we made together. So what I'm trying to tell you, is that I am not putting this album out so you should feel the need to defend me on the internet against someone you think I wrote a song about 14 million years ago when I was 19."</p><p>For his part, Mayer appears to have let any beef with Swift go as well, and he even has some insight as to why "Paper Doll" did not chart as well as Mayer would have liked it to.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Nothing bothers me anymore," Mayer explained to Entertainment Tonight. "There are going to be times when I make music as popular or empirically as [Swift's] in terms of making pop music that won't sell as many copies and I'm fine with that."</p><p>As for "Paper Doll" being one of those songs that did not chart well, Mayer believes that fans got caught up in it being a revenge song rather than truly listening to the lyrics. As such, it is time to end the feud and just be artists expressing themselves.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Taylor Swift's Tours Have Been Outrageous And Filled With Controversies: The Truth About What Happened Behind The Scenes</a></span></p><p>"She's an artist. I'm an artist," Mayer explained. "Everybody stop, nobody's got cancer. We're rich people who get to live out our dreams. Let's just stop it. I'm bigger than one song or one record."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, fans will always speculate <a href=#>who the songs are about that Swift and Mayer wrote</a>. But with both parties staying mum and wanting to put the past behind them, perhaps, fans should as well.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYsCwusasZJ2hlGK3sLTNZqSasZWneri%2ByK2cZpmSpMK1edOasKWnomLAuLXFrWY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjohn-mayer-s-paper-doll-might-have-been-about-taylor-swift-but-it-s-a-stretch.html&text=John%20Mayer%27s%20%26quot%3bPaper%20Doll%26quot%3b%20Might%20Have%20Been%20About%20Taylor%20Swift%2c%20But%20It%27s%20A%20Stretch&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjohn-mayer-s-paper-doll-might-have-been-about-taylor-swift-but-it-s-a-stretch.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjohn-mayer-s-paper-doll-might-have-been-about-taylor-swift-but-it-s-a-stretch.html&title=John%20Mayer%27s%20%26quot%3bPaper%20Doll%26quot%3b%20Might%20Have%20Been%20About%20Taylor%20Swift%2c%20But%20It%27s%20A%20Stretch" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjohn-mayer-s-paper-doll-might-have-been-about-taylor-swift-but-it-s-a-stretch.html&title=John%20Mayer%27s%20%26quot%3bPaper%20Doll%26quot%3b%20Might%20Have%20Been%20About%20Taylor%20Swift%2c%20But%20It%27s%20A%20Stretch" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjohn-mayer-s-paper-doll-might-have-been-about-taylor-swift-but-it-s-a-stretch.html&title=John%20Mayer%27s%20%26quot%3bPaper%20Doll%26quot%3b%20Might%20Have%20Been%20About%20Taylor%20Swift%2c%20But%20It%27s%20A%20Stretch" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjohn-mayer-s-paper-doll-might-have-been-about-taylor-swift-but-it-s-a-stretch.html&description=John%20Mayer%27s%20%26quot%3bPaper%20Doll%26quot%3b%20Might%20Have%20Been%20About%20Taylor%20Swift%2c%20But%20It%27s%20A%20Stretch" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./sasha-vujacic-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sasha Vujacics Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./fans-call-brad-pitt-trash-for-working-with-harvey-weinstein-despite-what-angelina-jolie-went-t.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fans Call Brad Pitt Trash For Working With Harvey Weinstein Despite What Angelina Jolie Went T">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
