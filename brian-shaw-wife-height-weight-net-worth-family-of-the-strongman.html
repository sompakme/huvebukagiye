He boasts of Squat of 903 pounds, Deadlift with Straps of 1,014 pounds and Atlas Stone of 560 pounds as he has virtually won every major Strongman tournament he has stepped into.</p><p>He has gone ahead to win numerous competitions throughout his professional strongman career which includes Strongman Super Series, Jón Páll Sigmarsson Classic, Giants Live and All-American Strongman Challenge. The giant athlete has also dabbled in the movie industry as he has featured in many films and television series including Kickboxer: Retaliation, Whose Line Is It Anyway? and Louder With Crowder. Here are amazing facts about Brian Shaw alias Gigantor.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=brian-shaw-biography></span><strong>Brian Shaw Biography</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Strongman champion was born in the statutory city of Fort Lupton, Weld County, Colorado, the United States on 26th February 1982 to Jay Shaw and Bonnie Shaw. His father, Jay used to repair power lines for a local power company. He was brought up along with his younger brother and sister, Kevin Shaw and Julie Shaw. Regarding his academic endeavors, Shaw attended Fort Lupton High School where he was very active in basketball.</p><p>Following his graduation from high school, he entered Otero Junior College. Soon after the completion of his junior college studies, Shaw earned a full basketball scholarship to Black Hill State University, South Dakota where he graduated with a degree in Wellness Management. He also gained admission into Arizona State University for his Master’s degree program but opted out to build his strongman career.</p><p>Brian Shaw was introduced to strength sports in July 2005 through his encounter with Richard Sorin, the founder of Sorinex, a corporation that produces weightlifting structures for Denver Broncos after Shaw lifted 172 pounds Thomas Inch’s dumbbell with one hand in his presence. Three months later, he made his first strongman appearance in the Denver Strongest Man contest and emerged the winner without any formalised training.</p><p>The 6 feet 8 inches athlete eventually turned pro in June 2006 after barely nine months of his introduction to the strength sport and began his journey to become the strongest man in the world. It didn’t take him long to establish himself as a force to be reckoned with as he began breaking and setting several records.</p><p>The year 2009 was a great year for him as he clinched many strongman titles including emerging the winner of All-American Strongman Challenge, Los Angeles Grand Prix, Gothenburg Grand Prix and the Overall Champion of the Strongman Super Series. In addition to that, Brian Shaw went on to become the first modern competitor to clinch both the World’s Strongest Man and Arnold Strongman Classic titles the same calendar year. His career achievements include being a 4-time World’s Strongest Man champion, 3-time Arnold Strongman Classic champion, 6-time Strongman Super Series champion, 2-time Jón Páll Sigmarsson Classic champion and many others.</p><p>Furthermore, Shaw has made several appearances as an actor in films and television shows, with his credits including Kickboxer: Retaliation and Whose Line Is It Anyway?</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=net-worth></span><strong>Net Worth</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Having a huge social media following with over 12 million views on his YouTube channel, Shawstrength which fetches him an enormous fortune, Brian Shaw has garnered an impressive wealth from his online presence and equally from his strongman career.

The following year, precisely, 15th June 2016, the couple enlarged their small circle with the arrival of their daughter, Braxton. They later welcomed another child, Kellen a few years later.</p><p>Apart from being a supportive wife and a wonderful mother, Keri Jenkins is also a fitness specialist who owns a fitness academy known as, Fit Mommy Academy.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=height-and-weight></span><strong>Height and Weight</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Brian Shaw is quite tall as he stands at a magnificent height of 6 feet 8 inches (2.0 m) with a huge accumulated body mass of 200 kg (441 lb).
