"We sat there confused!" Same, Cam, same!</p><p>"So confused," Emily agreed. "This was before we had announced to the world that we were still together, and he was trying to get the clout that me and Chase were together and it was so bizarre," she said.</p><p>Well, this didn't sit well with Cam, who made it clear he wasn't about any type of that nonsense, <strong>prompting him to unfollow Chase on social media</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Cam unfollowed Chase on Instagram," Emily shared.
