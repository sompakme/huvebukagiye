It is famous for television series like The 100, Arrow, Vampire Diaries, Jane the Virgin, Riverdale and The Vampire Diaries.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is <a href=#>home to some of the biggest stars</a> in the world of TV shows; from Arrow’s Stephen Amell, to Grant Gustin, who plays Barry Allen in The Flash, to Peyton List who has had stints on Smallville and 90210.</p><p>When you are one of the biggest stables in the country and home to some of the biggest stars on TV today, you can also become the biggest target for attacks and lawsuits either against your production team or the artists whom you choose to work with.</p><p>With scandals running riot in Hollywood like candy on Halloween, every&nbsp;production has had to institute strict standards of conduct for its actors so that its image is not dented. Such a scandal that rocked Hollywood was the <a href=#>#MeToo</a> hashtag that went viral in October last year to protest harassment and inappropriate advances in the workplace. It began when <a href=#>allegations were leveled against Harvey Weinstein</a>. CW, is no different, formulating rules which, anyone wishing to continue working with the company, has to follow.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here, are 20 Rules Every CW Star Has to Follow In Order To Stay on the Network:</p><h2 id=no-haughty-attitude><strong>No Haughty Attitude</strong></h2><p>When one becomes a celebrity, with their names dripping off fan's lips and every major brand looking for their signature so that they can become their brand ambassador, it is easy for this new status to get to one’s head.</p><p>You begin to get trolled, everything you do becomes an overnight sensation, and your fans literally begin to worship the very ground that you walk on.</p><p>The danger of this is that, for those new to fame, it can cause them to develop a haughty attitude, <a href=#>causing them to be obnoxious</a> not only to their cast members but to everyone in general. This causes them to think they are better than everyone else; they are always feuding with production managers and assistants, making inconsiderate demands before they can perform.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From Rosie O’Donnell to Russel Crowe, these are examples of celebrities who allowed their status and fame (and maybe money) to turn them into terrible human beings that were almost impossible to entertain, leave alone work with.</p><p>For many production stables, when one becomes too much of a pain, the best and only option is usually to let them go and replace them with somebody who’s a little more palatable. Remember <a href=#>Charlie Sheen</a>? (Source: WhatsCulture)</p><h2 id=you-must-get-along-with-your-co-stars><strong>You Must Get Along With Your Co-Stars</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Chemistry is everything</a> when it comes to the screen. Casting directors have the arduous task of ensuring that the people they cast to work alongside one another have such free flowing chemistry that it could be mistaken for a real life occurrence. When we think of Richard Gere and Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman, or Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling in The Notebook, we see perfect examples of what on screen chemistry should look like.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, when the director yells “CUT” and all the lights and cameras are turned off, and it would be our desire for the on screen chemistry to blossom into off screen friendships or romances, <a href=#>this is not always the case</a>. This was not the case for Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams who, despite the attempts of director Nick Cassavetes, could not get along on set. And who can forget about Shannen Doherty’s disputes with co-star Alyssa Milano and producer Brad Kern that led to her eventual exit from the show Charmed.</p><p>Some of the reasons given for actors not getting along included creative differences and some actors being difficult to work with. All that aside, it is requisite for actors to get along for the sake of the success of the projects they are working on together.

We grew up with some of them; from when they were child stars on Disney and Nickelodeon, till they became adults and some ventured onto the silver screen, breaking the mold that had been associated with them. When we think of stars like Jessica Biel, Miley Cyrus, and Daniel Radcliffe, we feel as though they are a part of our families and that our lives are a lot better with them in it.</p><p>Now we would love to see them on set and in front of our televisions at all times but the fact is, they are human beings who have lives; and sometimes, things happen in their lives that will force them to<a href=#> take a hiatus from entertaining</a>. From divorce, to the death of a loved one, to acute medical conditions, circumstances can cause our beloved stars to disappear from the screens.</p><p>However, as much as actors can take breaks for personal reasons, their off-screen lives should not in any way interfere with their work, especially if it affects shooting schedules, deadlines and their overall performance on the show. In the event that this happens, then the network may have no alternative but to let them go.

The ratings tell you how well the show is faring, whether or not people like it, what they think about it and what it is they think can be done to make the show better.</p><p>When the ratings are high, it means higher budget, better pay and assured longevity of the show on a platform that is thronged with new and more innovative shows every other day. When people stop caring about your show and begin to move on, this is shown by the ratings. The production is left with two options, find a way to make the show interesting, or face possible cancellation. Many popular shows have faced the ax this season.</p><p>As a cast member, you can get written off the show if it means that the ratings will spike. One show that frequently does this is Arrow. Such was the case when <a href=#>Sara Lance, played by Caity Lotz, who was written off at the beginning of season 3</a> to allow her sister Laurel Lance become the Black Canary.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although the timing was a little off, writing off Sara helped the show to get well on its way to developing their intended storyline.&nbsp;Plus, Sara was brought back for DC’s Legends of Tomorrow. So no harm, no foul. (Source: DCComics)</p><h2 id=the-director-holds-creative-priority><strong>The Director Holds Creative Priority</strong></h2><p>When an actor or actress takes up a role on TV, they are expected not only to play that role, but to <a href=#>become who they portray</a>. They are supposed to think, feel, talk and act like the character they are supposed to portray. When this is successful, you get Oscar-worthy performances like that of Heath Ledger in Batman: The Dark Knight. The actors become slaves to their roles; sacrificing their bodies and sometimes their sanity just so their performance is as convincing as possible. As time goes by, and the actors begin to get ideas on how their characters can be improved so as to make the show or production better. Some ideas are adopted, while others are shelved.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With all these suggestions coming their way, directors at the end of the day maintain creative priority. If the ideas fit into their vision for the character, they are adopted but if they clash with their vision, they are flushed.</p><p>As unreasonable as this may sound, the director has to ensure that their vision for the project is not lost with all the changes that inevitably happen during the shooting of a television series. They, therefore, have the last say when it comes to creativity.</p><h2 id=you-have-to-adjust-to-the-provided-budget><strong>You Have To Adjust To The Provided Budget</strong></h2><p>In theory, a big budget film set should be the happiest place on earth. There's free food, you're doing something you love, and you're getting paid ungodly amounts of money to pretend to be a time traveling teenager, or whatever. It is the kind of environment that every actor dreams to work in, because it gives you unlimited possibilities and allows you to fully express your creative genius as the budget is not an issue.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, this is not always the case. Many projects, especially when they are in their pilot phase, or are reprising but have not gotten a strong financial backbone, have had to make difficult financial decisions in order to keep the projects afloat. Some of these decisions can range from using cheaper equipment, to having stars take pay cuts, to using more affordable on-site locations.</p><p>Not all who are presented with these options are usually open to them. Take the example of <a href=#>Chad Michael Murray</a>, the dreamboat of One Tree Hill. Murray left the show at the end of season 6. Later on, he would disclose that his main reason for leaving the show that thrust him into the limelight was due to economic considerations. He was let go because the producers wanted to save money. <a href=#>The same was the case for Terrence Howard,</a> who did not reprise his role in Iron Man 2 because he refused to take a pay cut.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=you-cannot-have-two-conflicting-roles-with-other-networks><strong>You Cannot Have Two Conflicting Roles With Other Networks</strong></h2><p>When we were introduced to Wentworth Miller, it was in the role of Michael Scofield; a man who deliberately sent himself to prison in order to break out his brother, Lincoln Burrows, and help him escape the death penalty for a crime he did not commit in the FOX television series, Prison Break.</p><p>When the show wound up, he went on to take up other roles, and most recently as Captain Cold (Leonard Snart) in the CW TV series, The Flash. He was not a regular cast member but when he appeared, he always stole the show. He would then be recruited to be part of The Waverider’s crew in the spin-off series, DC’s Legends of Tomorrow.</p><p>When the show Prison Break was renewed and Wentworth had to split his time between duties between being Captain Cold and Michael Scofield, it <a href=#>began to pose a challenge</a>, especially with the production team. When it came down to the wire and he had to choose, <a href=#>he went with Prison Break</a>, probably because there he was the star and not just part of the crew.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>I guess you cannot have conflicting roles when you work with the CW; you either choose them or they drop you. (Source: HollywoodReporter)</p><h2 id=semi-clad-photo-shoots-is-a-no-no><strong>Semi-Clad Photo Shoots Is A No-No</strong></h2><p>One of the perks of being a star, whether on the silver screen or on television, is that you become a fan favorite. The more high profile titles and production houses that you get under your belt and are associated with, the more familiar your name becomes on the lips of fans. They get crazy about you, wanting to know everything about you; from what you like to do in your free time to what aspect of society irks. This can only lead to one thing; glossy magazine covers will begin knocking on your door. Look at what happened with Danai Gurira after her Black Panther success- <a href=#>Ebony</a> came calling.</p><p>However, the stars need to be careful not to get carried away by the glossy magazine offers, as the management of their network may not be for every form of publicity. This was the case with Jessica Biel; who was playing the eldest daughter of the Camden clan on 7th Heaven.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When she turned 18 however, she set out to prove that she was not just the good girl she portrayed on TV, posing semi-clad for <a href=#>a shoot with Gear Magazine</a>. This did not go down well with the producers of the show and Jessica Biel was subsequently written off the show, with Mary Camden being shipped off to her grandparents to turn her life around. (Source: USMagazine)</p><h2 id=any-off-screen-scandal-is-unacceptable><strong>Any Off-Screen Scandal Is Unacceptable</strong></h2><p>As much as we sometimes choose to overlook it, the stars that we have come to worship are as much human as we are. This makes them privy to bad judgments, mistakes and looking for ‘alternative ways to deal with the pressures that the job comes with. Long shooting schedules, difficult staff and sometimes unbearable co-stars can get someone to near breaking point.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Because of the pressures of being in the limelight, or simply flaws in their character, some of our beloved artists have been caught with ‘their pants down’, so to speak and this has caused a serious dent not only in their reputation and their possible future endeavors, but has also shed light on the networks they are affiliated to.</p><p>We all remember when <a href=#>Rob Lowe hit the news</a> after his alleged involvement with someone while campaigning in Georgia in 1989. Even though he feigned ignorance on the girl in the video being underage, the scandal did a great deal of damage to Rob Lowe’s reputation and affected his rise in Hollywood.</p><p>Therefore, while on the CW network, any such scandal that could put the network in the wrong kind of publicity is greatly advised against. Such was the case when rumors began to abound of the hatred between Nina Dobrev, Ian, and Nikki, but they were quick to get that all cleared up. (Source: Yahoo)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=be-willing-to-relocate-with-production><strong>Be Willing To Relocate With Production</strong></h2><p>It is quite costly to produce a successful show. This more the case when the show is a superhero flick and its fame is directly tied to the special effects that bring the story to life. This need for special equipment makes an already pricey production need more investment.</p><p>This was the case with CBS superhero television show Supergirl. The show was a hit in its first season while and everyone expected it to come back for the second season; this was everyone except the executives at CBS. The special effects associated with the show were quite expensive for CBS as the shoots took place in Los Angeles.</p><p>These expense issues were quickly addressed when <a href=#>the show moved to the CW</a>. Because the shots were being done in Vancouver, the production cost was much lower than in Los Angeles.</p><p>Unfortunately, not all of the Supergirl cast was willing to relocate to Canada for the sake of the show. This was especially <a href=#>true of Calista Flockhart</a>, who played the role of Kara Danvers' boss, Cat Grant. It was for this reason that Cat Grant virtually disappeared from Supergirl, apart from guest appearances in the season two premiere and finale, with Kara now reporting to editor Snapper Carr instead of Cat Grant.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As of season three, Cat Grant seems to have been written out of the show completely. (Source: Screen Rant)</p><h2 id=relationships-with-co-stars-should-not-affect-your-work><strong>Relationships With Co-Stars Should Not Affect Your Work</strong></h2><p>Off-screen romance between co-stars is a very common occurrence. Due to the long shooting hours away from the real world, many co-stars develop somewhat of a haven around the set and friendships usually develop. Some of these friendships eventually grow into romances.</p><p>Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, Johnny Galecki and Kaley Cuoco, and Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck are some examples of on-screen romances that spilled off camera with some of them developing serious relationships that led to marriage.</p><p>However, not all these romances have fairytale endings, with some ending up in breakups while she stars were still filming together; as was the case with Blake Lively and Penn Badgley, or Ian Somerhalder and Nina Dobrev.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Irrespective of the emotional turmoil that comes with a breakup, the co-stars are still expected to maintain a professional working relationship and their performance while on set should in no way be reflective of any affairs that are taking place off-screen. When this cannot be achieved, as is common with terrible breakups, then the production team may be forced to write off one of the characters or switch up the storyline to fit the current situation.</p><h2 id=the-company-reserves-the-right-to-hire-and-fire><strong>The Company Reserves The Right To Hire And Fire</strong></h2><p>One of the most difficult things to get through is when a network lets you go or deletes your character from a show. Not only is it difficult because of financial reasons, but also the gap that comes with not being able to continue doing what it is that brought one fame and made them a fan favorite. When we think of One Tree Hill, we think of Hilarie Burton and Chad Michael Murray; when we think of Gossip Girl, we cannot fail to picture Jenny Humphrey, played by Taylor Momsen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>All of these stars eventually left the shows that had made them household names.</p><p>While some may try and fight their termination and salvage all they can from the situation, <a href=#>cases like that of Taylor Momsen</a> were all but sealed, with the company exercising its right to hire and fire because she refused to shape up and was unreliable.</p><p>No matter how fans or co-stars may feel about the addition or removal of a character from any show, the company still has the exclusive powers to hire and let go any star as they see profitable. At the end of the day, they do what they feel is right for the company and the show. (Source: HollywoodLife)</p><h2 id=in-the-show-being-written-off-is-not-final><strong>In The Show, Being Written Off Is Not Final</strong></h2><p>When we think of all the CW’s recent superhero and masked vigilante shows, one thing clearly stands out; when your favorite character gets taken out, do not mourn. They will probably be brought back from the dead, severally if need be (we are looking at you Arrow), or they will appear in a crossover with the other shows in the network – most probably The Flash – or as a character in one of the entangled multiverses that the shows have created.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many characters who died at some point during the several shows that it has under its belt, somehow find their way back to the screen. Whether it is by reincarnation or flashbacks, it is clear that at the CW, the death of a character is not the end.</p><p>Katie Cassidy’s Laurel Lance/Black Canary, Manu Bennett’s Slade Wilson/Deathstroke and Wentworth Miller’s Leonard Snart/Captain Cold are prime examples of how the stable always finds a way to write off and bring back a character as the show or fans demand.</p><p>Therefore, if in any case, an actor has their character written off during a season, they should not burn the bridges just yet. That inevitable phone call always comes.</p><h2 id=you-do-not-question-the-director-s-judgement><strong>You Do Not Question The Director's Judgement</strong></h2><p>As shows progress, directors and producers can sometimes pick up on an idea which they believe will take the show to a new level. After deliberation with the relevant stakeholders, the ideas are usually adopted or put on ice for future consideration or altogether trashed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From introducing new characters, to changing the storyline from the original script to writing off some characters, all this is usually done to keep its fans glued to their screens and ensure the show’s survival on a platform that is all about the ratings.</p><p>It's unclear precisely why Katie Cassidy's character <a href=#>Laurel Lance was written out of Arrow</a> near the end of the series' fourth season, though a variety of rumors still persist.</p><p>One claims that Cassidy had been feuding with the producers over her decreased importance on the show in the wake of the writers' attempt to capitalize on the chemistry between Stephen Amell and Emily Bett Rickards. However, none of these have been substantiated.</p><p>The truth is that the director’s judgment is final, even if the cast or the fans do not agree with it. A great internet backlash after the directors decided to write off Laurel Lance but they stuck to their decision.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Most recently, it was announced that <a href=#>she would return to Arrow</a>, but in an evil role. (Source: TVGuide)</p><h2 id=you-must-bring-your-a-game-to-the-show><strong>You Must Bring Your A-Game To The Show</strong></h2><p>When an actor is brought onto a show, their presence is expected to give the show a boost, from where it is to where it is needed to be. When a comic is added to play that role, we expect a few more laughs because of their presence. If an actor who commands a presence, like Dwayne Johnson or George Clooney, are brought on set, we expect the set and the show to be electrified (pun intended).</p><p>There have been <a href=#>great successes</a> when certain actors got certain roles in movies and television shows; like Jim Parsons in The Big Bang Theory, Denzel Washington in Training Day and Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada. Their presence helped their affiliate shows and movies become just the much better. And let’s not forget Morgan Freeman.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There have, however, been <a href=#>great actors who did not show up for the party</a> with each role they took. In fact, for some, it is like the more roles they took, the worst they got. Names like Gerard Butler who spiraled after his famous 2007 portrayal of Leonidas in 300, somehow never got his groove back.</p><p>For the CW, every actor who is brought onto a show must bring their A-game or risk being let go.

Reporters are always shoving cameras and microphones in their face, asking them about this and that, and what their opinion is about such and such. It is sometimes referred to as the price of fame; you always have to be ready for impromptu press conferences and have the right answers for every question.</p><p>For the experienced stars who have been in the limelight for long, they know which safe answers and phrases to use when ambushed by reporters about a controversial subject, choosing the right combination of phrases to kill off any possible witch hunt that may have been directed their way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, for the newbies who just burst onto the scene, they do not yet have the experience of dealing with reporters, kore so tabloid reporters, who have the habit of finding controversy where there is none.</p><p>Once such TV star who discovered this was <a href=#>Bear Grylls of the Man Vs Wild fame</a>. He is known for taking big risks for the sake of entertainment. However, he got on parents’ wrong side after he made remarks about taking his children paragliding without the required safety gear.&nbsp;Lesson: be careful what you reveal to the press.</p><p>But then you have the cast of Supernatural, who not only doesn't seem to care very much what they say to the press, but if they have a problem with something, they say that out loud and proud as well. Probably because they are the only ones who have been in the CW business for so long that they practically make their own rules.

This may be the first name that comes to mind when we begin to talk about Hollywood stars who have tried to evade the IRS.</p><p>The silver screen is loaded. From the glam and luxurious lives which we see them live, it is no secret that TV stars are raking in the bucks because of their roles in TV shows. Kristen Stewart, Angus T Jones, and Jim Parsons are some of the stars who at some point were the highest paid stars in Hollywood. The money raked in not just from TV shows, but movies and endorsements must have made their bankers pretty happy.</p><p>The other people who were just as happy about their success is the IRS, as this means that they get to file huge tax returns.</p><p>However, there have been those stars who have <a href=#>thought they could escape the snare of the IRS</a> and failed to file their returns.

This led to the #MeToo hashtag going viral as more and more people, more so female stars, coming out to give their experience with some of the biggest names in Hollywood whilst they were still unknown actresses climbing up the ladder.</p><p>The aftermath of this movement was many companies having very serious Public Relations problems while others, like Netflix, canceled shows in which the actors were in any way connected to the scandal; they <a href=#>canceled House of Cards</a> after its major protagonist Kevin Spacey was indicated in the allegations. Very many A-list actors and stakeholders <a href=#>came out to denounce</a> those mentioned in the scandals, while some even went ahead to regret having worked with some of the producers like <a href=#>Woody Allen</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Because if this, any company that wishes not to have a public relations nightmare at their doorstep, will need to put in place policies and regulations on what is termed as acceptable and appropriate conduct between male and female co-stars.

Think back to <a href=#>Jamie Foxx and LL Cool J’s fighting</a> on the set of the 1999 film, Any Given Sunday. The fight got so out of hand at one point that the Miami-Dade County Police had to get involved. The actors exchanged blows at Miami’s Pro Player Stadium while filming a scene. Maybe they got a little too caught up in their roles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The same incident was witnessed with <a href=#>Criminal Minds actor Thomas Gibson</a>. After initially getting suspended for two episodes for kicking producer Virgil Williams in August 2016, Gibson was dismissed from the CBS drama amid revelations of past strikes on his record. He had had an altercation with another producer in 2010 and had also been ordered to anger management. His character, Hotch, was written out as having joined Witness Protection to protect his son from notorious unsub Mr. Scratch.</p><p>It is clear that violent behavior is in no way welcomed on the set of Hollywood’s TV shows. Violent altercations between stars are only reserved to fight scenes. (Source: MTV)</p><h2 id=no-use-of-slurs><strong>No Use Of Slurs</strong></h2><p>Every hip-hop fan is familiar with some of the slurs that have become characteristic and are normally associated with that genre of music. In fact, if you have been listening to it for long enough, then such terms as are used become a norm for you.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As the world becomes more and more liberal, the use of racial and orientation slurs are becoming more and more common, with pop culture being majorly to blame as it continues to sweep across the globe.</p><p>However, for the conservatives, the use of slurs, especially in public, is totally unacceptable. This is the predicament that <a href=#>celebrity cook Paula Deen</a> found herself after it was discovered that she had used&nbsp;a slur. In a lawsuit filed by one of her former employees against Paula and her brother, she was accused of using it while she was planning a plantation-style wedding, and that she wanted black waiters to play the role of slaves. Another star, this time from the CW who has made similar mistakes is Cole Sprouse.</p><p>Every actor, therefore, needs to be careful not to be caught on the other end of this; whether it was said deliberately or it came out in the heat of the moment.
