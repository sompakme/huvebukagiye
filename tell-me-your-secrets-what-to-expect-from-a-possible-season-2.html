Genuinely terrifying at times, the first season of 'Tell Me Your Secrets' ends on a huge cliffhanger that begs the question: will there be a second season?</p><p>At present, Amazon hasn't renewed the series for a second installment yet. However, the show hasn't been canceled either, which might leave some hope for fans who want more answers about what's next for Emma and Mary. If you haven't watched the whole of season one just yet, you might want to look elsewhere now as this article discusses the series in very spoiler-y details.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-39-tell-me-your-secrets-39-about>What Is 'Tell Me Your Secrets' About?</h2><p>Created by Harriet Warner, 'Tell Me Your Secrets' has everything you might want from a good thriller: unsettling truths to uncover, some graphic, violent scenes you won't easily forget, and a few spine-chilling, tense sequences you'll be tempted to watch through your fingers. But what is the show about exactly?</p><p>As we said, the series focuses on Emma, formerly known as Karen Miller, released from prison after covering for her ex-boyfriend and serial killer Kit Parker (Xavier Samuel), who is currently in jail. Co-protagonist Mary is a grieving mother desperate to find her missing daughter Theresa (Stella Baker), who disappeared years prior in connection to Parker.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Eve Hewson Talks Getting Into Character For Netflix Thriller Sensation 'Behind Her Eyes'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Parker commits suicide in prison, Mary hires a convicted rapist searching for redemption John (Hamish Linklater) to find Parker's ex-girlfriend Emma, now in witness protection in Louisiana. There's a catch: Emma obviously doesn't want to be found. And not just that, she claims she can't recall certain incidents from her time with Kit and is adamant she has never met Theresa. Except she has, as viewers learn in a flashback.</p><p>As Emma's memories start trickling back in, the Louisiana town she now calls home is plagued by a killer on the loose. Emma's new friend, teenage girl Jess (Emyri Crutchfield), is brutally murdered in the bayou, thickening the plot.</p><h2 id=the-finale-of-39-tell-me-your-secrets-39-leaves-many-questions-unanswered>The Finale Of 'Tell Me Your Secrets' Leaves Many Questions Unanswered</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After an unnerving game of cat and mouse between Emma and Mary (via John, who doesn't seem too remorseful about his predatory past, after all), the season finale of 'Tell Me Your Secrets' shocked fans with some big revelations.</p><p>In the final episode, the long-anticipated confrontation between the two women takes place, but not before they kill John, who had started blackmailing Mary after becoming obsessed with her and had threatened Emma as well.</p><p>Jess's killer is revealed to be her bully Rose (Chiara Aurelia), covering up for her father and his religious fanatic cult with a penchant for fertility experiments on young girls. Yet, the biggest twist of it all is that Theresa wasn't the innocent girl Mary had thought her to be.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What The Cast Of 'You' Do In Their Free Time</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Emma finally remembers that Theresa and Parker were having an affair behind her back, who was pregnant at the time. Jealous of Emma, Theresa tried to kill her and left her for dead in the snow. But Emma was very much alive and gave birth to Parker's daughter, calling her Freya and entrusting her to a foster family.</p><p>In the final scenes, Theresa, who now goes by Karen (confusing, right?), is seen as she kidnaps Emma's daughter Freya.</p><p>Mary, who has found out about Theresa's real nature from Emma, is left grappling with this disturbing discovery. However, it doesn't seem to be much of a surprise to her given she had read her daughter's journal. According to Theresa's diary, she had been with Parker long before he started dating Emma/Karen.</p><h2 id=39-tell-me-your-secrets-39-2-may-focus-on-theresa-39-s-backstory>'Tell Me Your Secrets' 2 May Focus On Theresa's Backstory</h2><p>While a second season hasn't been greenlit yet, 'Tell Me Your Secrets' may return to our screens and give us the answers we need.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a possible second chapter, we should definitely learn more about Theresa's backstory. Where has she been hiding all these years while her mother was frantically looking for her?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Shocking Reason Why Kate Mara Never Returned To American Horror Story</a></span></p><p>Given Theresa has taken Freya with her, it isn't unlikely for Emma to try and track them down to reunite with her daughter in season two.</p><p>As for Mary, it would be interesting to see how she will move forward with the knowledge that Theresa is a killer. Will she keep up appearances? On the other hand, Mary has killed a man â€” will anyone ever find out what happened to John after she and Emma disposed of the body?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-does-39-tell-me-your-secrets-39-2-premiere>When Does 'Tell Me Your Secrets' 2 Premiere?</h2><p>Given the show hasn't been officially renewed yet, a possible second season wouldn't start streaming before 2023, probably in the second part of the year.</p><p>As for its cast, it's pretty safe to say that both Lily Rabe as Emma and Amy Brenneman as Mary would return in a second chapter. Baker might reprise the role of Theresa, in both flashbacks with Rabe's Emma/Karen and Samuel's Parker, as well as in the present, in her storyline with Freya. John is dead and gone, though Linklater may still appear as the character in some flashbacks.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>The Truth About Lily Rabe And Hamish Linklater's Relationship</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirnqScYrqmediorKtlo5qws7HTrGSwoJGperW7jJ6vqZ2TqXqnvs6mZKydkai8r3mRaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftell-me-your-secrets-what-to-expect-from-a-possible-season-2.html&text=Tell%20Me%20Your%20Secrets%3a%20What%20To%20Expect%20From%20A%20Possible%20Season%202&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftell-me-your-secrets-what-to-expect-from-a-possible-season-2.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftell-me-your-secrets-what-to-expect-from-a-possible-season-2.html&title=Tell%20Me%20Your%20Secrets%3a%20What%20To%20Expect%20From%20A%20Possible%20Season%202" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftell-me-your-secrets-what-to-expect-from-a-possible-season-2.html&title=Tell%20Me%20Your%20Secrets%3a%20What%20To%20Expect%20From%20A%20Possible%20Season%202" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftell-me-your-secrets-what-to-expect-from-a-possible-season-2.html&title=Tell%20Me%20Your%20Secrets%3a%20What%20To%20Expect%20From%20A%20Possible%20Season%202" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftell-me-your-secrets-what-to-expect-from-a-possible-season-2.html&description=Tell%20Me%20Your%20Secrets%3a%20What%20To%20Expect%20From%20A%20Possible%20Season%202" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tommy-tiernan-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tommy Tiernan Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./sean-kingston-net-worth-therichest.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sean Kingston Net Worth | TheRichest">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
