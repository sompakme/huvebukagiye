The star's unquestionable modeling skills may lead one to believe she has a diva-sized ego, but she emanates a welcoming aura and is believed to be extremely modest. <a href=#>Gigi's success is no fluke</a>; she was born to former television personality and model Yolanda Hadid and real estate mogul Mohamed Hadid.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gigi, who climbed the ranks of mainstream stardom with ease, left an enduring impression on the modeling world at an early age. Social media is a window into <a href=#>Gigi Hadid's wonderful life</a>, but a carefully controlled feed limits the visual scope. There is a lot more to discover about the 27 years old model. Let’s take a look at Gigi Hadid’s rise to fame and fortune.</p><h2 id=gigi-hadid-started-her-modeling-career-as-a-toddler>Gigi Hadid Started Her Modeling Career As A Toddler</h2><p>Gigi Hadid was modeling for a fashionable fashion business before she even learned how to weave together words to form complete phrases. According to an interview with Vanity Fair, after being discovered by Guess co-founder Paul Marciano, she received her first modeling job for Guess Kids. As documented by Allure, in 2020 she made the globe collectively exclaim "Aww!" with a truly beautiful throwback photo from the campaign. The model uploaded a black-and-white image of her two-year-old self wearing a denim jacket and white overalls to her Instagram Stories.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">famous model mother Yolanda Hadid</a> recalls how many brands wanted to photograph young Gigi. Yolanda Hadid once revealed that she let her daughter model a little bit until she was 8 or 9 years old, and then she pulled her away totally until she was 17 years old. Yolanda continued by stating that she has always had a tremendous desire for both of her daughters to develop as actual individuals, rather than being assessed based on their appearance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yolanda also knew early on that she wanted <a href=#>Gigi and Bella Hadid</a> to have a regular childhood and be grounded. She opined that if you do not permit your children to work at a young age and there are no cameras on them, then they are simply growing up freely. Meanwhile, Gigi is thankful that her mother did not allow her to become a working model until she was in her late teens, as she believes the experience would have been too scary.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Becoming Forrest Gump: Here's How Tom Hanks Became A Hollywood A-Lister</a></span></p><h2 id=gigi-worked-hard-to-make-a-name-for-herself>Gigi Worked Hard To Make A Name For Herself</h2><p>Gigi Hadid was born into a rich family, but it did not prevent her from working hard to establish her reputation. If anything, the success of her parents inspired her own work ethic. Observing them as she grew up was a constant source of inspiration for her. During a 2018 Reebok event, <a href=#>Hadid reportedly vented her anger</a> at individuals who criticize her upbringing and use it to suggest she does not deserve her success in the modeling industry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She revealed that her father was a refugee and that her mother lived on a farm. Her mother then moved to New York and worked to support her family. They labored tirelessly to provide her with a life, and now, she works tirelessly to commemorate their efforts. It should be emphasized that Hadid's supermodel fame did not just result from her mother's modeling success. She has experienced numerous rejections throughout her life, notably when she originally auditioned to be Victoria's Secret model.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She had to audition twice before <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her dream of becoming an angel was realized</a>, but she stayed calm and composed. Gigi stated that she panicked as she entered the room. She was extremely worried, and she believes that her nervousness manifested as shyness. Obviously, in the show, you have to bring it, and if she was that frightened during the casting process, she was not prepared to do so. However, she nailed it in the end.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Becoming Spider-Man: A Look At Tom Holland's Rise To Fame And Fortune</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=making-her-own-millions>Making Her Own Millions</h2><p>Gigi Hadid's extravagant jet-set lifestyle is sponsored by the money she has made from several modeling jobs, brand endorsements, and other means. At the time of writing, Celebrity Net Worth estimates her net worth to be $29 million. According to her real estate magnate father, Mohamed Hadid, she has never taken even a dollar from her parents. In 2018, Forbes ranked her as one of the <a href=#>world's highest-paid models</a> with a $9.5 million annual income. The same year, the stunning model appeared on her 35th international Vogue cover.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, as of the date of this writing, model Lauren Hutton holds the record for most Vogue covers, having appeared in an astounding 40 editions. But Gigi is close to surpassing Hutton's record, although this is not necessarily her top priority. The model told i-D in 2021 that she no longer feels the desire to be a cover girl. She stated that she would want to defer to a new face, someone for whom it would significantly alter their life or career at this time.</p><p>Gigi has claimed that she is currently harnessing her creativity to <a href=#>breathe life into design concepts for her own business</a>, despite the fact that she has already achieved all of her goals in the fashion industry and is now aching for a career shift. Since Gigi is a mother now, she thinks it would be great to spend multiple days a week at the same office, studio, or whatever it is that she works in, with the same crew and the same people, and perhaps create a playroom for Khai at work.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>The 8 Highest-Grossing Zendaya Movies, Ranked</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicki Swift</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Insider</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington Post</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS1sMOMoKCgoV2drqW1w6xkm52Tlrqmec6nnGanlmLBqbGMraapZaOqvaa%2BzKibnqSjYravedOhnGavn6e5pXs%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-gigi-hadid-s-became-one-of-the-top-supermodels-in-the-world.html&text=How%20Gigi%20Hadid%27s%20Became%20One%20Of%20The%20Top%20Supermodels%20In%20The%20World&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-gigi-hadid-s-became-one-of-the-top-supermodels-in-the-world.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-gigi-hadid-s-became-one-of-the-top-supermodels-in-the-world.html&title=How%20Gigi%20Hadid%27s%20Became%20One%20Of%20The%20Top%20Supermodels%20In%20The%20World" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-gigi-hadid-s-became-one-of-the-top-supermodels-in-the-world.html&title=How%20Gigi%20Hadid%27s%20Became%20One%20Of%20The%20Top%20Supermodels%20In%20The%20World" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-gigi-hadid-s-became-one-of-the-top-supermodels-in-the-world.html&title=How%20Gigi%20Hadid%27s%20Became%20One%20Of%20The%20Top%20Supermodels%20In%20The%20World" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-gigi-hadid-s-became-one-of-the-top-supermodels-in-the-world.html&description=How%20Gigi%20Hadid%27s%20Became%20One%20Of%20The%20Top%20Supermodels%20In%20The%20World" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./inside-50-cent-s-garage-massive-car-collection.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Inside 50 Cent's Garage Massive Car Collection">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./connor-sturgeon-girlfriend-reddit-speculations-about-his-love-life.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Connor Sturgeon Girlfriend: Reddit Speculations About His Love Life">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
