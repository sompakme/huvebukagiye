Relatively new to the scene, Wonders comes in hot with some pretty impressive credentials. She's the niece of a famous fashion figure – ok, so she's a "nepo baby" – however, this Ivy League graduate still has accomplished plenty in her own right.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Wonders is a model, actress, director, and writer, and even once handpicked for an iconic campaign (Clue: Kate Moss, Justin Bieber, and Mark Wahlberg have also been a part of this legendary brand), not through her family connection, but through discovery by none other than director Sofia Coppola.</p><h2 id=chase-rsquo-s-aunt-is-a-famous-fashion-designer>Chase’s Aunt Is A Famous Fashion Designer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/chase-sui-wonders-hot.jpg><p>If Chase Sui Wonders' middle name sounds familiar, that's because Wonders is the niece of fashion designer Anna Sui. Wonders grew up with an access to fashion that only fashion fiends can ever dream of.</p><p>“When we were little, we would sit front row, but on the ground,” <a href=# rel=nofollow>Wonders said</a> of her early fashion memories. “In some videos, you can see us on the runway crawling around and fighting.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But her big break into modeling did not stem from her aunt.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow title="What Happened To Kate Moss’ Little Sister Lottie?">What Happened To Kate Moss’ Little Sister Lottie?</a></span></p><p>Back in 2017, Wonders starred in a Calvin Klein commercial celebrating women of all ages, directed by Sofia Coppola.</p><p>For the campaign, Wonders got to be in good company. Some of the famous faces and names included actress Rashida Jones and Kirsten Dunst, who previously worked with Coppola for the Virgin Suicides, Marie Antoinette, and The Beguiled, and model-actress Laura Hutton, who was 73 years old at the time of the shoot.</p><p>Handpicked by Coppola, Wonders spoke fondly about her experience. “She had an insane, soft power that was all-consuming when you were around it,” recalled Wonders.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the campaign, the models clad in Calvin Klein undergarments <a href=# rel=nofollow>shared intimate anecdotes</a> on topics like their "First Kiss," "Crush," or "First Love."</p><p>In the feature, shot in black and white, Wonders, dressed in a tasteful black négligée, looks into the camera as she lounges in bed and perches on a stool. In her segment, she shares the story of her first kiss.</p><p>Coppola and Wonders reunited again a few years later when Coppola cast Wonders for her film, <a href=#>On the Rocks, starring Bill Murray and Rashida Jones</a>.</p><p>Fans can catch Wonders next in Apple TV+'s City on Fire as Samantha Cicciaro, one of the main leads in the mystery-thriller series.</p><h2 id=sui-wonders-39-other-accomplishments-include-writing-and-directing>Sui Wonders' Other Accomplishments Include Writing And Directing</h2><p>Not only has Wonders made a splash in the fashion world, another notch of her accomplishments includes being a graduate of Harvard University. Wonders majored in film and production and graduated magna cum laude.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And like these iconic comedy writers B. J. Novak, Conan O’Brien, and Colin Jost, who also count themselves as Harvard alumni, she also wrote for the institution’s celebrated humor publication, The Harvard Lampoon.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow title="Scarlett Johansson Reveals What Made Her Fall For Colin Jost">Scarlett Johansson Reveals What Made Her Fall For Colin Jost</a></span></p><p>Her early acting experiences were on stage at Harvard but when her performance in Chekov’s Three Sisters was torn apart by her peers, she pivoted to writing.</p><p>“I couldn’t handle the criticism,” <a href=# rel=nofollow>she said</a>. ​“I didn’t have thick enough skin – I wanted to be the anonymous person behind the camera, writing. That was my focus while studying.”</p><p>After she recovered from the scarring experience, she continued to write and direct while gaining experience in small parts in front of the camera.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This eventually led to a bigger role in the horror film Daniel Isn’t Real and was later cast in HBO’s Generation, a series similar to Euphoria, about high school students in the suburbs of Orange County exploring their identities and sexuality.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow title="How Close Are Colin Jost And Pete Davidson?">How Close Are Colin Jost And Pete Davidson?</a></span></p><p>Most recently, she starred in A24’s horror-comedy Bodies Bodies Bodies, where she played the girlfriend of Pete Davidson’s character.</p><p>“Bodies Bodies Bodies splices a section of privileged kids who live a very sheltered existence that’s a breeding ground for entitlement and small-mindedness. It also attacks this image-conscious sense of youth, holding a mirror up to that – however ugly the reflection might be,” said Wonders of the film’s message.</p><h2 id=chase-shares-an-ex-with-cami-mendes>Chase Shares An Ex With Cami Mendes</h2><p>Wonders first popped up on Hollywood’s radar through her relationship with Riverdale’s Charles Melton. <a href=#>Melton had previously dated his Riverdale co-star Cami Mendes</a> on and off since 2018 and cooled things off in 2021.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sometime in 2021, Wonders and Melton were photographed looking loved up on dates around New York City. They later starred in a short that Wonders directed for Vogue China.</p><p>Wonders, who is half Chinese, worked with Voguefilm’s initiative to support Chinese women in film for this project.</p><p>After about a year together, the premiere of <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Whale in November 2022 marked their last public appearance</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/chase-sui-wonders-pete-davidson-bodies-bodies-bodies.png><p>These days, <a href=#>it looks like Wonders moved on with Bodies Bodies Bodies co-star Pete Davidson</a>. The pair attended a basketball game in December and have been seen around town hanging out in the city.</p><p>Most recently, the two spent time frolicking on the beaches of Hawaii, looking very much like a couple.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On having worked with Davidson, Wonders noted his sense of humor and talent.</p><p>“He’s hilarious!” Wonders said. ​“We had a lot of dark exchanges in the movie, so it was nice to have some relief outside of that, to have a good guy who can bring levity and humor to the role. He’s also a total pro who’s very good at dramatic acting, which I’m so excited for everyone to see.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecKhmKydXajCqnnWqKWdnaKoeqetzKisrGWWpL9w</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhere-s-how-chase-sui-wonders-was-discovered-by-sofia-coppola.html&text=Here%27s%20How%20Chase%20Sui%20Wonders%20Was%20Discovered%20By%20Sofia%20Coppola&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhere-s-how-chase-sui-wonders-was-discovered-by-sofia-coppola.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhere-s-how-chase-sui-wonders-was-discovered-by-sofia-coppola.html&title=Here%27s%20How%20Chase%20Sui%20Wonders%20Was%20Discovered%20By%20Sofia%20Coppola" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhere-s-how-chase-sui-wonders-was-discovered-by-sofia-coppola.html&title=Here%27s%20How%20Chase%20Sui%20Wonders%20Was%20Discovered%20By%20Sofia%20Coppola" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhere-s-how-chase-sui-wonders-was-discovered-by-sofia-coppola.html&title=Here%27s%20How%20Chase%20Sui%20Wonders%20Was%20Discovered%20By%20Sofia%20Coppola" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhere-s-how-chase-sui-wonders-was-discovered-by-sofia-coppola.html&description=Here%27s%20How%20Chase%20Sui%20Wonders%20Was%20Discovered%20By%20Sofia%20Coppola" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kevin-hart-gifted-chris-rock-a-goat-its-name-is-will-smith.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kevin Hart Gifted Chris Rock A Goat (&amp;amp; Its Name Is Will Smith)">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./hannah-lee9-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hannah_Lee9 Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
