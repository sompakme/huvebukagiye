For instance, Perry co-starred in The Whole Nine Yards alongside Bruce Willis back in 2000. In this action-comedy flick, Perry played Nicholas “Oz” Oseransky, a dentist who discovers that his new neighbor, Jimmy Tudesky (Willis), is a contract killer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While working together on this film, Perry and Willis quickly became fast friends. In fact, in his memoir Friends, Lovers and the Big Terrible Thing, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Perry revealed that the two would often go out partying together</a>. "But there was a big difference between Bruce and me," Perry wrote (via Entertainment Weekly). "Bruce was a partier; I was an addict. Bruce has an on-off button. He can party like crazy, then get a script like The Sixth Sense and stop the partying and nail the movie sober. He doesn't have the gene — he's not an addict."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Bill Maher Was Emotional Over His Final Interview With Matthew Perry, Claiming Fans Had Him In The 'Dead Pool'</a></span></p><p>However, it was after the parties had ended that Perry learned how incredible of a person Willis really is. In his memoir, Perry wrote that when the cameras weren’t rolling, he "saw the real Bruce Willis — a good-hearted man, a caring man, selfless." The Friends star further added, "A wonderful parent. And a wonderful actor. And most important, a good guy." The two would reunite once again in 2004 for the sequel, The Whole Ten Yards.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=matthew-perry-showed-his-support-for-bruce-willis-after-the-actor-was-diagnosed-with-aphasia>Matthew Perry Showed His Support For Bruce Willis After The Actor Was Diagnosed With Aphasia</h2><p>In 2022, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Bruce Willis was diagnosed with aphasia</a>, a cognitive disorder that affects a person’s ability to communicate.

You will remain in my prayers for a long long time. Maybe we should get together and watch the whole 10 yards and get a couple of hours of sleep,” Perry tweeted. Furthermore, the Friends star revealed that after hearing about Willis’ diagnosis, he kept his former co-star in his thoughts and prayers. He adds, "I, of course, pray for him every night now," Perry wrote in his memoir.</p><p>Upon Perry’s sudden death on October 28th, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Rumer Willis shared a wholesome memory of meeting the Friends alum</a> while he and his father worked together in The Whole Nine Yards. “I’m so sad to hear about Matthew Perry passing. When I was a kid and I was on set ... he was so kind and funny and sweet with my sisters and me ... I know he had many challenges in his life and brought a lot of joy to people with his comedy. I hope he can rest peacefully,” Willis shared in an Instagram story.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=matthew-perry-convinced-bruce-willis-to-make-a-cameo-on-friends>Matthew Perry Convinced Bruce Willis to Make a Cameo on Friends</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AD64E1A7-C9D3-45EB-A64D-0F9544D7E488.jpeg><p>In 2000, Bruce Willis made a brief cameo on Friends, playing Paul Stevens, the over-protective father of Ross Geller’s much younger girlfriend Elizabeth. Willis did such a good job that this became the <a href=# rel=nofollow>best cameo in Friends according to fans</a>, and he even won an Emmy for his performance.</p><p>Believe it or not, Willis only appeared on Friends because he lost a bet to Matthew Perry. It all started when the two worked together in the movie The Whole Nine Yards. "Bruce hadn't been sure the film would work at all, and I'd bet him it would — if he lost, he had to do a guest spot on Friends," Perry wrote in his memoir.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Matthew Perry Took A Serious Approach To His Interview With David Letterman</a></span></p><p>Ultimately, The Whole Nine Yards grossed over $106 million at the box office worldwide, which was a significant gross margin against its $41 million budget.
