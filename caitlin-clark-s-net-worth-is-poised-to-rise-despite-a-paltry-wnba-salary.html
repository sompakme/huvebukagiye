Clark finished her collegiate career on a high note.</p><p>In November 2023, she achieved a milestone by becoming the top scorer in the history of the Hawkeyes basketball program. She also reached an impressive 3,000 career points.</p><p>By mid-February 2024, Clark became the highest scorer in NCAA Division I women's basketball history.</p><p>Clark made history once more by becoming the highest scorer ever across men's and women's NCAA Division I basketball.</p><p>Clark departed Iowa with an impressive record, boasting the highest career points (3,951) and three-pointers (548) in Division I history. She also scored the second-most triple-doubles (17) and the third-most assists (1,144).</p><p>Following the season, it was announced that Iowa would retire her jersey number 22, making her the third player in program history to receive the honor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On February 29, 2024, Clark announced that she would declare for the 2024 WNBA draft.

Clark's initial WNBA earnings fall short of six figures.</p><p>As the first overall draft pick, Clark will receive a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">starting salary of $76,535</a> for the 2024 season. This base pay increases modestly over her four-year rookie contract, reaching $97,582 by 2027.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On April 19th, the New York Times covered Caitlin's WNBA contract, and echoed other outlets' assertions that it <a href=#>was shockingly modest for an athlete of her caliber</a>:</p><p>"Her starting pay for the Fever — the Women’s National Basketball Association team that selected her as the No. 1 draft pick [in April] — is part of a four-year contract that will total $338,056.</p><p>"But to some fans, it still seemed startling low for someone with her star power — especially compared with what her male counterparts in the National Basketball Association make."</p><p>Lower draft picks land smaller salaries based on a predetermined scale established in the WNBA's collective bargaining agreement with its players.</p><p>It is important to note that this base pay can be supplemented with performance bonuses. For instance, the "Rookie Of The Year" award comes with a $5,150 bonus.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, even with potential bonuses, Clark's initial WNBA pay still pales in comparison to her counterparts in the NBA.</p><p>For reference, Victor Wembanyama, the number one pick in the 2023 NBA Draft, will earn over $12 million in his first year playing for the league.</p><p>This disparity in salaries between the WNBA and NBA has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sparked renewed debate about fair compensation</a> for professional women athletes in the US, as Vox.com explained:</p><p>"The fresh attention for the WNBA draft, however, is also spotlighting the problems the league has had with pay equity. For years, the WNBA’s salaries have lagged the NBA’s by a massive margin.</p><p>"That’s due in part to the leagues’ differences in revenue and season lengths. But other factors, like differences in collective bargaining agreements and revenue-sharing, also play a big role."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong

signature shoe bearing her name.</p><p>While competing offers from Under Armour and Adidas offered substantial sums – $16 million over four years and $6 million over four years, respectively – Clark ultimately opted to continue her collaboration with Nike.</p><p>The eight-year Nike deal, which was announced on April 18th, will earn her an average of $3.5 million per year, adding a significant
