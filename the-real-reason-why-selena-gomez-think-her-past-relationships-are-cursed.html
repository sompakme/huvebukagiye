The former Disney star is one of the most popular singers, actors, and entrepreneurs of our time, but questions about her past relationships continue to swirl around her like they're the only thing she's known for.</p><p>And recently, she opened up about it — telling a publication she’s convinced her love life has been “cursed.”</p><h2 id=who-were-selena-gomez-rsquo-s-past-boyfriends>Who Were Selena Gomez’s Past Boyfriends?</h2><p>Selena has been involved in <a href=#>a few high-profile romantic relationships</a> during her impressive career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2008, she had a romance with Nick Jonas and it all went well for a few months. Unfortunately, the pair obviously didn’t work it out as Nick dated various other celebrity ladies and is now married to actress Priyanka Chopra.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Nick Jonas And Priyanka Chopra Jonas’s Relationship Started In This Weird Way</a></span></p><p>Then in 2009, the 'Lose You to Love Me' singer was romantically linked to Taylor Lautner. They met while she was filming Ramona and Beezus in Vancouver and Taylor was in the midst of filming Twilight: New Moon.</p><p>Despite the fact that they were both in the thick of filming, they made time to get to know each other.</p><p>Their romance, however, did not continue long. Selena has always had nothing but positive things to say about him. It doesn't sound like the two of them had a terrible breakup or anything.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, among her well-known past relationships, Justin Bieber is the most constantly linked to Selena even after their multiple break-ups.</p><p>Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez's romance began in 2010. The young couple made headlines all around the world since both of their followers were overjoyed to see them in a relationship. They were constantly photographed together by paparazzi, looking happy all the time.</p><p>As people say, they were the definition of “young and in love,” yet no one really expected things to turn sour between the two when they split in April 2014.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After her split with Justin, Selena was romantically linked to Orlando Bloom. The pair were spotted allegedly flirting at a Victoria’s Secret fashion show. Both have denied the rumors but it is reported that they got together to make Justin Bieber and Miranda Kerr jealous.</p><p>Fortunately for Selena, she reconnected with Justin in June 2014, but their relationship was already pretty toxic until they separated ways in October 2014.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Selena Gomez’s Relationship With Justin Bieber Was Doomed From The Start, Here’s Why</a></span></p><p>Despite heartaches, Selena still found love again in January 2015. She was in a relationship with Zedd from January to March of that year.</p><p>Then in December 2015, she was spotted with One Direction member Niall Horan on a date at the Santa Monica Pier in California. In 2016, she was linked to Samuel Krost and Charlie Puth but their connection was “very short-lived.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Then in January 2017, Selena had her second most famous relationship with The Weeknd. After ten months of dating, they decided to part ways in October 2017. In that same month, Selena and Justin Bieber had their third reconciliation. This time, their relationship lasted for six months.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Tell Selena Gomez To ‘Move On’ After She Shades Justin Bieber</a></span></p><p>While Selena ended up releasing a couple of heartbreaking songs, Justin got married to model Hailey Baldwin, leaving Selena to move on in the spotlight.</p><h2 id=why-did-selena-gomez-think-her-love-life-is-cursed>Why Did Selena Gomez Think Her Love Life Is Cursed?</h2><p>Selena Gomez spoke to Vogue Australia<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">about the difficulties of falling in love</a> when you're young and in the spotlight.</p><p>The 29-year-old stated that she has always felt less than her lovers and that their relationships, as intense as they may have appeared at the time, lacked equality and emotional maturity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Speaking about her past, she said, “I think most of my experiences in a relationship have been cursed. I’ve been way too young to be exposed to certain things when I was in relationships.”</p><p>She continued, “I guess I need to find what was that word for me, because I felt so less than in past relationships, and never really felt equal.”</p><p>Meanwhile, whether in a romantic affair or in a friendship, Selena said she’s seen connections become stronger amid the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>She explained, “I hope people understand how fragile life is, but how beautiful it is at the same time. I’ve seen people become lighter, more patient, actually (having) a lot of intellectual conversations, real substance. You can tell that’s happened with people.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The singer continued, “It’s so special when you’re with someone. You never get to value that, or you’re so involved in your phone.
