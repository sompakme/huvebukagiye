However, beneath the paparazzi snapshots and glossy magazine covers, the truth behind her rejuvenated looks remains veiled in secrecy.</p><p>As an actor and influencer, Paltrow has faced criticism for promoting <a href=#>wildly unhealthy and restrictive eating practices</a> and undergoing cosmetic procedures that allegedly ended in unfavorable outcomes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-gwyneth-paltrow-39-s-controversial-starvation-diet>What Is Gwyneth Paltrow's Controversial Starvation Diet?</h2><p>During an interview on The Art of Being Well podcast, Gwyneth Paltrow shared her eating habits and wellness routines. According to the actress, she starts her day with a cup of coffee before fasting until midday. Following that, she dedicates an hour to exercise, typically indulging in bone broth for lunch, and opting for an early paleo-style dinner.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/is-gwyneth-paltrow-s-diet-actually-wildly-unhealthy_-the-real-story-about-what-the-wellness-influencer-eats.jpg><p>Paltrow also mentioned that she occasionally includes celery juice with lemon or lemon water in her routine, asserting that her body doesn't naturally detoxify itself. While online discussions have <a href=#>criticized her diet for being overly restrictive and potentially promoting disordered eating</a>, the actress later clarified on her Instagram Stories that she doesn't adhere to this regimen every day. She emphasized that she consumes a broader variety of foods, debunking the notion that she was providing advice for others to follow.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Page Six, Paltrow blamed her post-Covid symptoms for her food choices saying, "The way it manifests for me is very high levels of inflammation over time, so I've been working with Dr. Cole to really focus on foods that aren't inflammatory. I eat full meals, and I also have a lot of days of eating whatever I want.

Criticism from public figures like Tess Holliday and Meghan McCain further fueled the debate, with concerns raised about the potential impact on a younger generation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Gwyneth Paltrow's Spending Is Even More Obnoxiously Extravagant Than Her Controversial Goop Products</a></span></p><p>During the podcast, The Guardian also reported that Paltrow was hooked up to an IV, which the actress explained, "My baseline has been to try to eat healthy and try to eat foods that really calm the system down."</p><p>Paltrow revealed that she sometimes injects herself with nutrients, mentioning her preference for Phosphatidylcholine IVs when available.

Over time, this could contribute to conditions like osteoporosis, hypertension, cognitive impairment, and even increase the risk of developing cancer.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Gwyneth Paltrow Doesn't Regret Turning Down A Classic That Made $2 Billion Worldwide</a></span></p><p>Celebrities like Paltrow, with their appealing looks and extensive followings, wield significant influence, and their health claims can be readily accepted as reliable.

Just like <a href=#>Love Island's Molly Mae and her drastically different look</a>, Paltrow spoke about her personal journey, including a midlife crisis at 40, which led to an unfortunate experience with wrinkle-smoothing injectables, leaving her feeling unlike herself, "...It was a disaster. I didn’t do anything else for a long, long time. I was bruised, my forehead was completely frozen, and I didn't look like myself at all."</p><p>The Goop founder expressed the challenges she encountered during experimentation with procedures, shedding light on the reality that even those in the public eye can face unexpected outcomes. However, she also noted that she is now the face of Xeomin, an injection targeting frown lines between the eyebrows, which implies her comfort with responsible use.</p><p>Aside from discussing her experiences, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paltrow also shared insights into the evolving beauty standards in Hollywood</a>, particularly among younger generations. She praised the trend of appreciating women for their true selves, regardless of age or appearance, citing inspiring figures like Jane Fonda and Frances McDormand as examples.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Safe Are Gwyneth Paltrow's Cookbooks?</a></span></p><p>In a September 2020 Instagram post, the Academy Award winner discussed her skincare regimen and facial enhancements, acknowledging that dealing with aging is a multifaceted experience.
