He played in the MLB for well over a decade.</p><p>Besides his gameplay as a player, people also loved him for his commentary since he was doing it for a couple of decades as well.</p><p>It was earlier this year that Ray stepped down from the broadcasting duties by revealing his cancer battle for the last 16 years.</p><p>Now,&nbsp;CBS Sports&nbsp;as well as all other sources confirm his demise at the age of 74 from same cancer.</p><p>But what was the cancer type that Ray Fosse was suffering from?
