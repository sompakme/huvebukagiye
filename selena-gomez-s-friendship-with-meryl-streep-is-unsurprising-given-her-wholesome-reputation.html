Gomez started acting at a young age in commercials but really blew up thanks to her work with Disney, specifically the hit show Wizards of Waverly Place. She established herself as a pop singer, body positivity activist, and makeup brand creator all while still following her acting passions and dealing with very personal, but also public, health issues.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meryl Streep was older than Selena Gomez when she got her start in the mid to late 1970s after being inspired by Robert De Niro's performance in 1976s Taxi Driver. From there, she worked hard to climb the ranks and win several prestigious awards throughout her career.</p><p>Now it seems that their worlds are colliding, with the pair working together on season three of Hulu's Only Murders in the Building and solidifying their friendship both on screen and off.</p><h2 id=selena-gomez-has-several-powerful-friends>Selena Gomez Has Several Powerful Friends</h2><p>Selena Gomez once said that her only industry friend is Taylor Swift, but the truth is Gomez is friends with several of Hollywood's most popular elite, with Swift just happening to be one of the most popular and influential among them.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>A Timeline Of Selena Gomez And Nicola Peltz's Friendship</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gomez and Swift have been friends for quite some time now, both <a href=#>having dated two of the Jonas brothers around the same time</a>.

The show follows the characters played by Gomez, Martin, and Short as true-crime fans who suddenly find themselves wrapped up in a real-life true-crime situation when a death occurs inside the building they all live in.</p><p>The trio then finds themselves attempting to find out who the killer, that possibly lives in their building, might be. Fans of the show know the chemistry between the main three actors is undeniable, but Only Murders in the Building almost didn't feature Gomez as its leading lady.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/instar51733438.jpg><p>Initially, the character Gomez is playing in the show <a href=#>was written as a male character</a>, and it was Steve Martin's suggestion to not only make the character female, but much younger than himself and Martin Short. Once the idea was out in the ether, executive producer Dan Fogelman knew Selena Gomez would be perfect for the role.</p><h2 id=meryl-streep-joined-the-cast-of-only-murders-in-the-building>Meryl Streep Joined The Cast Of Only Murders In The Building</h2><p>Only Murders in the Building has been a hit and is gearing up to air its third season on Hulu.
