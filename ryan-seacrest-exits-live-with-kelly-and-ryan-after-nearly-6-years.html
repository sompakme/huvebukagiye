She has been an amazing partner, friend, and confidant, and although we will always be a part of each other’s lives, I will miss our mornings together,” Seacrest said in a statement. “I also want to thank <strong>Michael Gelman</strong> and the entire staff and crew – we’ve made memories to last a lifetime, met some of the most incredible people and had the warmest welcome into the homes of so many viewers across America. It’s been a memorable ride and now <a href=#>I’m excited to pass the baton to</a> Kelly’s ‘real’ husband,<a href=#> <strong>Mark [Consuelos]</strong></a>.”</p><p>The 48-year-old TV personality joined <a href=#><strong>Kelly Ripa</strong></a> on the daytime show in May 2017 after a lengthy search for a permanent cohost. Seacrest also addressed the decision on the Thursday, February 16, episode of the morning show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Ryan-Seacrest-Is-Leaving-Live-With-Kelly-and-Ryan-After-Nearly-6-Years-Mark-Consuelos-to-Take-Over-895.jpg><p>Ripa, 52, has been part of the Live family since 2001. She succeeded<a href=#><strong> Kathie Lee Gifford</strong></a>, teaming up with the late <a href=#>Regis Philbin</a> for 10 years <a href=#>before his final episode</a> in November 2011.</p><p>“I’m so grateful to have spent the last six years beside my dear friend of too many decades to count and will miss starting my days with Ryan,” Ripa said in a statement on Thursday. “Ryan’s energy, passion and love for entertainment is one-of-a-kind.”</p><p>While he was still <a href=#>taping the syndicated talk show</a>, Seacrest continued his hosting duties on <a href=#>American Idol</a> and produced On Air with Ryan Seacrest for KIIS-FM. Staying on top of his busy schedule proved to be a challenge in late 2021 when he was <a href=#>noticeably absent from Live</a>. Fans began to grow concerned that the Emmy winner was experiencing exhaustion — and they weren’t the only ones.</p><p>“His team was so concerned they staged an intervention,” a source exclusively told Us in October 2021, adding that <a href=#>Seacrest was “in bad [shape].”</a></p><p>At the time, Consuelos, 51, joined his wife in Seacrest’s place. “Kelly is a pro and knows the show must go on,” a second insider told Us, noting that <a href=#>“Mark did a fantastic job supporting her and the whole cast”</a> in Ripa’s moment of need.</p><p>The <a href=#>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a> producer previously worried viewers in May 2021 when he <a href=#>seemingly slurred his words</a> during an episode of American Idol. The next morning, he missed a taping of Live — but Seacrest’s publicist <a href=#>shut down speculation</a> about his health.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Ryan-Seacrest-Is-Leaving-Live-With-Kelly-and-Ryan-After-Nearly-6-Years-Mark-Consuelos-to-Take-Over-894.jpg><p>“Ryan did not have any kind of stroke last night,” a statement asserted at the time. “Like many people right now, Ryan is adjusting to the new normal and finding work-home balance, with the added stress of having to put on live shows from home. Between Live With Kelly & Ryan, American Idol, On Air With Ryan Seacrest, and the Disney Family Singalong specials, he has been juggling three-four on-air jobs over the last few weeks and he’s in need of rest. So today he took a well-deserved day off.”</p><p>Despite his mysterious absence from Live that fall, a third insider told Us that the Georgia native was <a href=#>handling his jam-packed schedule</a> just fine. “He recognizes he needs to find windows of time to rest during these busy windows of work,” the source noted in October 2021.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Before leaving the morning show, Seacrest announced that he would be <a href=#>stepping down from hosting</a> E!’s live awards show coverage.</p><p>“After 14 years of hosting E!’s Live From the Red Carpet I’ve decided to move on to new adventures,” he said in a February 2021 statement. “I’ll miss the whole crew that works so hard behind the scenes and of course my amazing partner Giuliana [Rancic]. Thanks to everyone for watching all these years.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmymZ5iwKatwqucrKxdmsWqwNJmo6KulWLEqsDHZqKepJyueqK6w2apspmeYq6nwMSrZKedkae5unmVZrCemaKofA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fryan-seacrest-exits-live-with-kelly-and-ryan-after-nearly-6-years.html&text=Ryan%20Seacrest%20Exits%20%27Live%20With%20Kelly%20and%20Ryan%27%20After%20Nearly%206%20Years&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fryan-seacrest-exits-live-with-kelly-and-ryan-after-nearly-6-years.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fryan-seacrest-exits-live-with-kelly-and-ryan-after-nearly-6-years.html&title=Ryan%20Seacrest%20Exits%20%27Live%20With%20Kelly%20and%20Ryan%27%20After%20Nearly%206%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fryan-seacrest-exits-live-with-kelly-and-ryan-after-nearly-6-years.html&title=Ryan%20Seacrest%20Exits%20%27Live%20With%20Kelly%20and%20Ryan%27%20After%20Nearly%206%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fryan-seacrest-exits-live-with-kelly-and-ryan-after-nearly-6-years.html&title=Ryan%20Seacrest%20Exits%20%27Live%20With%20Kelly%20and%20Ryan%27%20After%20Nearly%206%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fryan-seacrest-exits-live-with-kelly-and-ryan-after-nearly-6-years.html&description=Ryan%20Seacrest%20Exits%20%27Live%20With%20Kelly%20and%20Ryan%27%20After%20Nearly%206%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tammy-knickerbocker-husband-kids-is-the-real-housewives-of-orange-county-star-related-to-shane-ke.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tammy Knickerbocker Husband &amp;amp; Kids: Is The Real Housewives Of Orange County Star Related To Shane Ke">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./rihanna-asap-rocky-keeping-son-s-name-a-secret-hope-for-baby-no-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rihanna, ASAP Rocky Keeping Son's Name a Secret, Hope for Baby No. 2">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
